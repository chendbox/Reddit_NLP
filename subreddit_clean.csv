4,cars,I apologize for the rant but I seriously need someone to give me some guidance before I lose my damn mind I took my car to a dealership for repairs for a couple reasons 1 My car horn stopped working 2 Cylinder misfires Now admittedly I hold myself accountable for the cylinder misfires I honestly forgot about changing my spark plugs and by the time it became an issue I lacked the tools necessary to DIY this I took my car a VW Dealership last Wednesday I was told that they wouldnt even be able to give me so much as a cost estimate without running a “full diagnostic” first Despite the fact that myself and the clerk who assisted me knew exactly what was wrong I figured Id have my car back in a matter of a few hours maybe a day naive I know I have changed spark plugs in older cars before and it doesnt take very long Not saying I know a lot about vehicles though Fast forward to last Friday night 2 days after dropping my car off I get a call from the dealership The clerk who helped me tells the mechanic knows what wrong but wants to “run more tests” and that I will get my car back Monday today So this morning I call the dealership and the clerk tells me that now the mechanic wants to drive it and make sure the engine isnt misfiring Sure Well I ask if I can get my car today as he said I would This guy is now telling me they need another day I am beyond frustrated However as someone who used to work in customer service I take the high road and continue to be polite with the guy Could someone please shed some light on why this is taking so long I understand my car isnt the only car in the world I just want to know if this is normal It makes me wonder if they are trying to wear me down into trading my car in for a new one I dont mean to sound like an asshole to all the mechanics of the world I just want my damn car back,Can any former or current car dealership mechanics tell me why its taking so long to get my car back,373
11,cars,Surely whichever car manufacturer makes one could see a rise in sales With the solid state batteries coming along Id say a manufacturer like Toyota would announce that theyre working on something Theres nothing like an mx5 for electric cars and with the newer laws in Europe its going to get harder and harder to buy and run a ICE So is it perhaps an untapped market,Isnt there a market for a small efficient electric sports cars like the mx5,67

18,cars,I recently watched a video by Throttle House youtuber they were putting the BMW M5 CS against Dodge Charger Hellcat RedEye 627hp 4100 pounds vs 797hp 4600 pounds Although I expected the M5 to be faster especially at its price point I didnt expect it to just destroy the Charger The Charger has 1 horsepower for every 58 pounds of the car while the M5 had 65 pounds per horsepower I know tuning was probably the answer damn I was shocked at the difference in power I didnt even want to see a GT500 go up against the M5,Why are European cars so powerful,99

22,cars,I can understand why exotic cars with exotic prices arent always exactly reliable they really arent meant for that and the absurd amount of money is justified by the crazy performance under the hood and head turning designs Talking about Rolls Royces and Bentleys is another pair of hands If I was spending half a million dollars for a car meticulously designed to be the most comfortable and luxurious ride I wouldnt certainly expect it to have issues a 20k Honda doesnt have Can someone give me an explanation,Why arent the extra luxury cars also the most reliable ones,89

35,cars,Is this what all auto engineers feel about engineering Know What It is To be An Engineer It is to have a dream without being conscious You are dreaming lest the dream break It is to be trapped in a terrible tower of pure science It is to live in a mean basic prison cell And regard yourself as sovereign of limitless space It is to turn failure into success mice into men Rags into riches stone into buildings steel into bridges For each engineer has a magician in his soul,Deloreans Poem in Netflix Documentary,91

40,cars,Title kinda explains it I drive a 2020 Audi A6 which has an amazingly responsive dual clutch probably contributing to the experience but ever since Ive learned the logics of shifting I almost exclusively drive with paddle shifters just for the engagement The only exceptions would be if I were in slow traffic or if I were holding a coffee in one hand or something and couldnt use both paddles but in most situations I like being able to have that extra level of control Automatics are near perfect these days but for example if Im on the highway and I need to pass somebody Id rather downshift in advance and have access to that horsepower immediately than floor it as Im changing lanes,Does anyone else almost exclusively drive with paddle shifters in their automatic,124
41,cars,Okay so lets say you have an engine dont know how much they weigh for the average car maybe like 300500 pounds So if you have just a strip of muscle weighing the same as that say connected to a gear with a pedal like contraption so it could turn the gears Which would be able to produce the most amount of force,Would an engine or a muscle of the same weight be stronger,63

51,cars,I am really upset about this First job I had some minor damage on my bumper from being rear ended I also had a large parking lot dent on my front passenger door Took my car in to have both repaired Once I got home I could still see parts of the dent present in the door and a small spot on the bumper was bubbling Also noticed some scuffing near my sunroof but wasnt totally sure if they did it so I didnt say anything I took it back in so they could redo the entire job Second job Finally a week later I get my car back Only to discover several hardened bubbles on the rear bumper Additionally I can easily indent the paint by lightly pressing my fingernail against the paint Are they not baking it Also I found new damage on the rear passenger door it almost looks like they polished it so much that it left scuffs ALL OVER the rear door and the plastic piece separating the front and rear windows My car literally looks worse There is no way in hell I am taking it back there a 3rd time Does anyone think they are going to give me a hard time if I ask for a full refund This job cost me 2k and it has more damage than before This is honestly totally unacceptable TLDR Had to take my car to the repair shop twice because each time they worked on it they left noticeable bubbling on the paint They didnt fully repair the dents and scuffed the hell out of a perfectly good paint job What should I do,Advice needed Took my car to the Certified BMW Auto Collision repair shop twice Each time it came back with more damage than before,279
52,cars,Diess was in a german talkshow and talked about Hydrogen and Hydrogenbased Fuels EFuels Since you probably cant speak german Ill translate The relevant clip is here We are developing and testing to figure out what those syntetic fuels could be We need those for ships Volkswagen is the biggest supplier in ship engines More than half off all ships are running on VW engines We cant electrify those ships Same with planes You cant electrify a plane We need hydrogenbased fuels there But why not cars Because its too expensive And it will continue to be too expensive The basis of that technology only works if we can produce it free of CO2 No fossil fuels Green Hydrogen So we need the sun or wind And the problem is that you have to transfer the green electricy into Hydrogen And you lose 70 of the energy in that process Which means you need 3 times more energy than with a battery electic vehicle 3 times as many wind turbines and solar energy No matter where you place them eg more efficent wind energy in chile more efficent solar energy in africa That means a car running on a fuel cell runs 3 times more expensive not 30 more expensive 3 times as much You cant substitute that No costume will pay for that Because the advantage is also not that great You also need the refueling infrastructer and a Hydrogen car also doesnt benefit from a better usage of space refering to the Toyota Mirai A Mirai also doesnt offer more usable space And it will remain this expensive for the forseeable future for at least 10 years For planes and ships yes because we dont have an alternative but for cars no,VW Boss Herbert Diess talks about why Hydrogen and Syntetic Fuels arent coming,294

100,cars,Hi so Im new to manual and just started a week ago I was looking through some posts and people said that when youre in the highway you can go from 5th gear to neutral and just use the brakes to get slow enough before shifting into a low gear for an exit Or you can sequentially go through each gear or skip gears depending on if the rpms match My question is if youre going from 5th to neutral and braking how do you know what rpms to match 2nd gear to once you switch Like I can brake until Im at 20mph but say I got there from 50mph my rpms dropped in that time period so when I clutch in how do I know what to rev match to Sorry if this is a stupid question I hope it makes sense,Question about downshifting,144

288,cars,Hey guys Im planning to buy a used car and I am currently evaluating two Jeep Renegade The first one is a 2019 model 13 T4 DDCT Longitude with 6500 km selling price 19900€ Second option is a 2021 model 10 T3 limited with 0km and a selling price of 20900€ I like to drive but I know very little about cars and engines so Im looking for someone with a little more knowledge that may help to make the right choice If you had to choose which one would you pick And if you need more info let me know Thank you,Looking for some advice,103
290,cars,Obviously it wouldnt make much sense for a tiny A segment sized car like a Fiat Panda to be premium but why does it have to be the other extreme why do you need to buy a huge 5 meter long boat like a Touareg X5 A6etc thats unpractical for city driving to have a luxury car For example an economy Opel Insignia is the same length as a premium BMW 5 so if economy cars can be long why cant premium cars be shorter VW Tiguan would be a perfect size for a smaller premium suv thats great for city driving but instead it pretty much has the same interior as the Troc which is criticized for having one of the worst interiors material quality wise with hard plastics everywhere where you touch So in case you want a premium SUV from VW you have to go all the way to a Touareg BMWs X1 is the same size and would also be a good small premium SUV its interior is even the same size as the interior of an X3 which is longer due to a hood built to fit a larger engine but instead the X1 has the interior of a 1 series hatchbackfrom the previous generation Why,Why do premium cars need to be oversized and unpractical,211

293,cars,I wanted to get your opinion on the best way to go about handling this situation My brotherinlaw used to work at VW for many years and his younger brother still works at the same location he used to be I went into the dealership yesterday to lease a car for my wife and the sales rep promised her they had blind spot assist on all of their cars She made sure to express that if a car does not have that safety feature she does not want to lease that car But he assured her it does On the way home from the dealership we realized there were 2 errors 1There is no blind spot assist 2 We signed a contract stating we are taking the car with 25 miles on it and there were 95 We needed to get that changed on the contract it matters because we only get a certain amount of miles each year We called back the dealership on the way back to the house to try to let the manager know what happened and to get revised paperwork The front desk assured me the manager would call me after he was done speaking to the client in his office We also texted the sales rep to inform him what happened and he assured me the manager would reach back out to me when he was done with his customer After about 2 hours my brotherinlaw even texted the manager his old boss to remind him that I am a family member to a former and active employee at that location and to just give me a courtesy call or text when he can We still did not get a callback After about 335 hours of me leaving the dealership with no callback or text I am finding the situation a little rude When the sales rep reaches out to me to tell me he can give back my wifes old car and take back the new one I remind him that I want to speak to the manager about that The sales rep desperately tries to tell me that I do not need to speak with the manager he can just give me a different car with the feature in it for the same price and we can move on In theory that is a decent solution but I dont know the logistics of it Do I need to run another credit check do my wife and I need to go back to the dealership and do more paperwork would it be the same month term etc That salesman was the one who was misinformed about a feature of a car I did not want to just take his word on the logistics of swapping out a different car after the paperwork is signed Also as time builds and no answer to my brotherinlaw or me from the manager I am finding it very disrespectful Eventually I hear back from the sales manager late in the night after I told the rep that I did not want to do business with that location The manager tells me that he is going to find a solution He said he would reach out to me on Sunday or Monday with some solutions What do you all think I should do Should I tell them to keep both cars and take my business elsewhere Or should I just accept the more upgraded car for the same price,Car salesman lied to my wife about a feature,581

401,cars,Cars have evolved so much that it requires a special kind of commitment to stick to an old one They are so much more comfortable reliable and safe that it take a hefty dose of nostalgia to offset all of that I assume many of you are just like me shackle by worldly concerns like “money” If some of those concerns were lifted what ride would be acceptable for you I would argue that some cars from the 70s had a level of comfort as good as today but handling and safety would be a big concern Anything older risk of being quite Spartan What is for you a proper everyday car that also give you a taste of the past,What is the oldest car you would daily drive,121

472,cars,One type of post I see more than any other on car forums is the classic why does everyone hate Its often from people who have recently discovered their dream car and while doing research have found a torrent of posts and articles calling it a horrible car and warning people against getting one then usually listing another car that is in every way better They then wanting to get reassurance from those who have had experience with their dream car make a forum post asking usually innocently why their car seems to have so much negative publicity As harmless as these posts are there is something that I have not seen any response mention there will always be someone who will dislike your dream car Let me make a few examples If your car is underpowered or slow but has good handling drag racers will dislike it If your car is powerful or fast but has poor handling gymkhana and drift guys will dislike it If you jack up your car on high suspension stance guys will dislike it and vice versa If they see you do something with your car that they would do differently they will dislike it If your car comes from literally any manufacturer fans of a different manufacturer will dislike it Unfortunately people will even dislike your car because its popular or overrated just because some people are like that That is why there will always seem to be more people that dislike your car than like it Yes there are some cars that are more liked and popular and therefore will receive less criticism than others but let me make this clear every car is disliked by someone and at least one person will voice their displeasure that it exists That is the unfortunate reality of being able to form an opinion But there is something you can do about it do whatever you want with your car Put a rally kit on your econobox and put it on airbag suspension Stance your offroad vehicle so low that it is undrivable Put a giant useless wing on your drift truck Express your individuality and ignore anyone who feels like they need to prescribe what you should do with your own car,The Simple Answer to All of Those “Why Does Everyone Hate My Car” Posts,378

480,cars,Anyone whos purchase a house post 2008 knows how extremely stringent mortgage qualification is nowadays Predatory lending is down by the wayside as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have installed new systems to vet potential borrowers Due to the quickly changing climate of a COVID world Most home shoppers find themselves Finally able to relocate out of HCOL more affordable cities Home prices are up around 2535 in the last year in some markets The demographic this hurts most is the first time buyer An FHA buyer or 5 conventional cant exceed certain debt to income limits in their qualification Or DTI For example a CONVENTIONAL buyer cant exceed a total mortgage payment of 45 of their taxable income after debts So in essence 60k salary 12 months 5000 GROSS Have say 500 a month in student loans and a 500 car payment So 4000 NET 4000 45 45 max amount allowed 1800 a month Which in my town is 340kish and wont give you shit worth living in But if youre renting or maybe in a roommate situation or even in one of these VHCOL cities where youre relegated to living with parents til they die and leave the house Why bother and not buy a fun car if youre priced out of real estate What stops the auto industry from spiking car past inflation and cranking prices as auto rates stay below 2 Most buyers shop in a “payment” mindset So now that rates have been bottomed out for few years and the average new car is near 40000 Not even a sports performance or anything terribly unique but a decently spec crossover And since COVID showed that due to demand prices can go up and offset any price increases with immediate sales What stops all car MSRPS jumping just 5k more next year because everyones so used to a 40k car being the new 30k,Do you think a long term surge in house prices will cause a long term surge in car prices as more home buyers find them selves priced out of homes and get “dream cars” instead,318

575,cars,Had to repost as my first one got removed So basically I moved recently and my new parking spot sucks Theres a rather steep hill required to get into the lot then to make matters worse my parking spot is at the edge next to a wall so not only am I going uphill I have to turn and somehow maneuver without hitting the wall or car next to me while doing it The whole spot is essentially a weird sideways incline And its friggin steep to get into that driveway you need to give your car a fair amount of power There are four spots and four cars I agreed with the landlord that I could get one of the middle spots when my neighbours boyfriend moved out but now hes back and is parking in that spot again Perhaps I should call the landlord I originally wanted to back into the driveway but learned very quickly that my clutch would burn like no tomorrow even at a very low RPM I thought of going up to the end of the driveway then reversing into the spot but trying to do that Im fighting gravity on the downhill and then I have to reverse up a slight incline to complete the maneuver which again smell I cant fully engage the clutch because of the lack of room so it slips So the best option is probably to park forward But its really difficult especially when people dont leave much room Ive already scraped my car on the wall once In addition Im not sure if trying to do this complicated maneuver uphill will wear my clutch out because whether going forward or backward I cant fully engage the clutch because of the slow speeds required Theres no street parking either so that isnt an option Im pretty stressed out about this Im literally debating replacing my car with an automatic one just because of this I live in fear of burning out the clutch haha Tldr my parking situation sucks and I drive a stick shift Does anyone whos dealt with this before have any advice,Recently moved and the driveway is rather steep and requires me to turn into my spot as Im going up the hill Any advice on not burning out my clutch,357

837,cars,Ill be all over the place with Qs trying to see if I understand things well and to cement knowledge Im not so sure of I remember hearing a while ago that an engines rated power is only available in the higher rpms example this Honda 2L engine Does this mean that when we drive on public road we only access a fraction of that engines power for eg 50100 Hp in the case of this Honda engine Small vs Large displacement for a certain displacement to run it takes a certain amount of fuel to run well ie too low too lean thus engine damage or so I read Larger displacement NA engines can pass more airfuel in one rpm so it basically does greater work load right Then I look at this guy has several vids somehow in the 6th the tuner maps somehow to get from 26 mpg to 40 mpg with the z06 57 L engine without overheating hwy driving btw HOW is that possible Would it be possible to have a map like that for city driving as well ie to make a larger engine use only a fraction of its power if needed That car is only 3200 lbs so not that much mass to move The curiosity comes from asking the question if there is a way to have a DDproject car in one which can be tuned to be economic and powerful at the flick of a switch I posted that question about turbo control along the lines of if you remember Now small displacement engine like a Civic tuned to give high power say 500 hp of course reinforced engine parts high volume air turbo etc the whole ordeal When is that power available From what I understand driving any turbo car normally 20003000 rpm normal driving gives normalstock mpg and power I was reading on a supra forum that getting better air flow with the mods intake manifold exhaust upgrades even improved the MPG as the engine wasnt struggling as much with moving air I also know that the turbo kicks in at a certain rpm say 4000 does that mean that until the engine is revved that high the car feels totally stock in that 20004000 rpm range it will get 50140 hp using chart above or whatever the stock engine was making btw turbo kicking in at a certain rpm is this dependent on the volumes of gases going out vs the geometry size of the turbo or what So if its the case that a small displacement car feels stock until turbo kicks in how and when is that tiny turbo engine producing 500 hp by revving higher than before simply by the amount of air the turbo manages to shove in I recall ottomh from vids on turbo civics that redline is pushed to 8000 or 9000 rpm vs stock 7000 ish so turboed cars seem to rev higher I suppose a modded car like this moves through its rpm faster than stock Is this due to the improved air flow basically,Power vs Displacement vs Rpm vs Fuel Consumption educate me,516

904,cars,I went to look at a preowned 2018 Honda Accord yesterday 22990 I noticed two problems while driving 1 There was something rattling every time I hit a bump or turned probably something loose no big deal 2 Something was wrong with the brakes When coming to a stop it wasnt smooth There was a pulsating feel My dad described it as an uneven grabbing of the brakes It was very noticeable it jolted the entire car I know nothing about cars but after googling it seems that its a rotor that needs to be replaced I told the dealer about the rattle and the choppy brakes He said hed have the crew look at it He called me back today and said 1 the rattle is just something a loose rearview mirror that needs to be tightened 2 the breaking in the front does seem like the front rotors need to be resurfaced because when you give it some pressure they wobble a little bit so theyre just uneven from usage and need to be resurface He said they are both easy fixes and they can do it if Im interested in the car Does resurfacing a rotor mean they arent replacing it Is this an actual fix or would it just mask a broken rotor for a few months until its an issue again Does this sound right Should I get it Its honestly a good price But Im worried that they wont fix it all the way,Should I get this used car with a brake issue dealer says they will fix it,250

1150,cars,As far as Im concerned these are multiple different vehicles so how is it they can be grouped into one and get such credit In 2020 for example Ford took the crown for most sold vehicle with the Fseries at 787000 units sold Of course that includes f150f350 and maybe more such as the f450f750 The same year GM sold a combined 839000 if you include Silverado and Sierra arguably the same truck from the same manufacturer but they were ranked as separate models and therefore didnt take the crown Getting outside the blanket truck monikers manufacturers use Fseries Silverado Ram and focus on specific models and assuming generously that 12 of Fseries trucks are F150s Ford still loses with more Toyota Rav4 sold than f150s Now I couldnt actually find data on F150 specifically so if someone can please chime in here I havent really seen this discussed or called out on before but it does seem odd that multiple models are considered one when it comes to ranking top vehicle sales on the year,How does Ford keep claiming the F series is the most sold vehicle in North America Its 7 different vehicles,176

1257,cars,Its my impression from afar that American car buyers expect to walk into a dealer and drive out that day in the modelcolourspec they want or pretty close to it The idea of ordering exactly what they want and then waiting for production or delivery from manufacturer stock seems unusual Is that right It seems weird to me that youd decide to purchase something quite expensive go through a process to work out what you want and then need to have it the instant you make up your mind Do dealers need to keep huge numbers of cars in stock What about smaller dealers or those in places where they cant have big lots Similarly I read complaints that dealers only keep whitesilvergreyblack cars in stock but ordering a green one if thats what you want doesnt seem like an option Personally Im used to going to a dealer choosing exactly what I want and waiting generally 26 weeks for delivery Two weeks because the spec I wanted was in manufacturer stock in another city and the longer waits because a car had to be built to my spec Have I misunderstood this,Do American car buyers expect to get what they want on the lot today,193

1330,cars,First off Im no expert and thats why Im asking you here Also german so I dont know the proper english terms for parts but Ill do my best Today while driving on the highway my car 2001 Peugeot 206 75 HP manual gasoline suddenly went into the red part of the temperature gauge and the stop light on the dashboard turned on but it went away as quickly as it did appear I stopped the car on a parking spot at the next exit to investigate and saw that the container for the cooling liquid was technically empty there was like 150ml left in it at best Im honest here I didnt bother checking the amount of cooling liquid for some time because there were no leaks and it was only recently allround fixed and checked for general inspection ca 3 months ago which was when the cooling system was approved without defect The temperature of the car never went out of the ordinary before as well so I thought everything was fine I called Adac to get my car towed home and the mechanic quickly checked the car on the spot he said its probably a broken cylinderhead gasket as there seemed to be some oily residue in what was left of the cooling liquid It would also explain where all the liquid went in the first place so quickly There was no liquid or whiteish residue in the oil however Id stop there but the aforementioned gasket was already replaced less than a year ago What are the odds it would break again so quickly And why did the temperature warning only pop up for a short few seconds and then go back to normal again I suspect something wrong with the thermostat andor maybe a leak in the cooling system that I didnt notice before Have you had similar experiences with similar cars What do you think could be the reasons for this could be and how can I fix it reliably Id prefer not to have the gasket replaced again within just one year but if thats the only way,HELP Peugeot 206 overheated what could it be,355

1774,cars,Ive had two cars with short shift throws Veloster Turbo Rally Edition124 Spider Abarth and I found them undesirable Its so easy to miss a shift when the gates are spaced nanometers apart These are the only two cars Ive ever shifted into the wrong gear with Theyre also unsatisfying to use Its like moving an Xbox joystick It feels like Im playing a Cruisn USA arcade cabinet It doesnt move anywhere The benefit of such a short throw is it being imperceptibly quicker to shift into the next gear Thats technically true but you need to wait for the revs to drop or climb for your next gear anyway and modulate your clutch Thats the big delay in the shift time not the speed that you move the gear lever If shaving 05 seconds off your 060 time is important then a manual transmission is the wrong game entirely My two favorite transmissions Ive used were my 500 Abarth and my Nissan Frontier The 500 is typically decried as having long rubbery throws but damn I loved rowing that giant stick on the dash around The Frontier was also fantastic Long throws You know youre in gear when the next one is in a different zip code You could feel the teeth on the gear mating It was very mechanical Am I the crazy one,Am I the only one that likes long shift throws,226

2533,cars,Controversial post here Just wanting to get peoples thoughts and experiences on this Im looking at the f87 M2 GT350 g87 M2 and new Nissan Z as a new purchase in the next year or so Many people such as Motortrend have put the M2 up there as one of the best cars available today However Car and Driver scored it last compared to the 781 Cayman S Supra and GT350 taking the top spot Matt Farrah of smoking tire also bemoaned the weight of the M2 Savage geese also wasnt crazy about it and criticized the weight and lack of steering feel and precision the most common criticism Chris Harris also likes it as he owns a CS The M2 is also described as the best BMW on sale today It seems that most of the good reviews come from Europe where in fact it might be the best performance car available short of a much pricier 911 S But compared to a gt350 it lacks the feel drama and precision of a true sports car So Im confused since some reviewers seem to really like it while others scorn it and I was wondering if compared to other BMWs does the M2 really shine but compared to more performance oriented cars its pedestrian 2 series roots ultimately have compromised the car as a true sports car beyond even M divisions ability Steering feel is a big thing for me and I may have to go back to the e92 M3 to get it I havent had a chance to test drive an M2 so Ill make up my mind for myself once I do but just wanting to get others options out there Based on the reviews it seems that the where the M2 excels is as a performance street cardaily driver but is too heavy and lacks the feel and precision to be a consistent track weapon Is the M2 just a good BMW or is it actually a good performance car relative to the competition Thanks,Is the f87 M2 that good or are current BMWs that bad,340

2550,cars,Growing up I was repeatedly told that you shouldnt connect the black cable to the negative terminal of the dead battery because there is a chance of a spark igniting hydrogen gas Instead you must connect it to a nearby metal piece to ground it A few years ago I was trying to jump a car and had grounded it to a metal bolt After several failed attempts I thought that maybe the bolt was the issue so I hooked the black cable directly up to the negative terminal The car started up instantly This has worked for me a handful of more times in the past few years Is there actually a measurable advantage to hooking the black cable up to the negative terminal or is it confirmation bias Whether or not the advantage outweighs the risks involved is a different matter entirely Im solely trying to determine if theres actually an advantage or if Im just imagining it,Is there any advantage to jumpstarting a car with the black cable connected to the negative terminal,160

2836,cars,So I stopped at a sheetz that offered unleaded 88e15 I was at about half a tank so I decided to try it out I was a little skeptical at first but I figured standard 87 has about 10 ethanol so I thought an extra 5 wouldnt hurt mixed with the regular 87 in my tank Performance wise everything felt about the same But what I noticed was a crazy increase in mpg After the fill up my range which is usually around 270 miles on a full tank was at 390 miles I ended up getting around 375 miles on that tank of gas From what Ive read gasoline that has a higher percentage of ethanol isnt as fuel efficient but in my case it gave me an extra 100 miles What gives Driving a 2018 Impreza,Unleaded 88E15,138

2909,cars,Hello all Ive been thinking about this topic for quite a while so to say I manage quite a big family fleet about a dozen cars and one of the most common expensive repairs that recurringly occurs to our vehicles is the alternator failure Of course there are shops that offer remanufacturing and the repair of the alternator itself which is cheaper than replacing right away but my generic perception is that the alternator is possibly the least modern technology we have in our cars They are inefficient heavy bulky and fail on a regular basis of 812 years So I took to Google and I found that OEMs like Mitsubishi Diamond Power series and Delco Remy do offer brushless alternators for heavy duty use These definitely seem expensive units but I was wondering wouldnt it be possible that with smaller capacity sized for a regular 2 liter I4 engine for example these might exist manufactured by a small startup company or in the Far East somewhere Or did I skip some overly negative property of the brushless motors that might make them unfavourable for automotive use,Brushless alternator for automotive use,187

3000,cars,I really like the small and quirky design of the 4C but there arent that many available in my country partially because it was discontinued Do you peeps have any suggestions for similarly designed cars So far Ive thought of the Audi TT most Lotuss the Alpine A110 I dont care too much about the price range Im just trying to find other beautiful cars that are like the 4C I really like the 4C because its small quirky has a very elegant facade has some performance and is fun,Cars with similar aesthetics or design to the Alfa Romeo 4C under 180k,90

3010,cars,While large sedans are traditionally associated with older folks as a younger guy I love large potent comfortable cruisers I dont understand why other people arent interested in these vehicles sub 50k After my Chrysler 300 I have no clue what Ill be able to buy other than a used Lexus LS It seems like a chicken and the egg problem Did manufacturers realize that they could charge more to make a crossover on the same platform and fail to update their product or do consumers suddenly want a higher riding vehicle en masse,Why are affordable full size sedans falling out of style in the US,94
3011,cars,I own a first generation Highlander and a friend of mine mentioned that there is a subculture in the car community that is obsessed with highlanders I thought this was sort of funny since Ive always been made fun of for the car being sort of a “mom car” The car truly does have some potential to be cool but I was wondering if there actually is a community that is that interested in the model If this is true could a kind soul steer me in the right direction to it Thanks,Old Toyota Highlanders,93
3016,cars,Over the years and through various vehicles Ive never been able to remember the compatible oil filters for my vehicles The oil filter lookup books at the stores sometimes arent there or dont cover all the brands Looking up oil filters on other websites makes you put your vehicle into some clunky interface and hope for the best I made oilfilterfindercom so anyone could look up your vehicle in a few seconds and get a summary of compatible brands and models Hopefully others will find it useful,I made a simple website for looking up oil filters for your vehicle,87
3017,cars,From what Ive seen and read the only slight letdown of the LFA was its transmission It was solid and could handle the revs of the V10 nicely but was a little clunky compared to all the other components which were so smooth and well refined to the chassis Ive often wondered what a 68 speed DCT couldve done for the LFA Or even the ubiquitous ZF8 automatic transmission Who knows It might have trounced a few more record holders at the Nurburgring But I think we can all agree that Yamaha tuned V10 is glorious,A new transmission for the Lexus LFA,96

3041,cars,So I moved into a new apartment a few weeks ago I drive a BMW 440i so it isnt a huge car but it isnt a compact car either Its a decent size I had no idea this would be a problem when I moved in but the parking situation here is terrible Essentially we have an underground garage where tenants park their cars Im in LA It isnt very big but there are spaces for about 810 cars and a wall opposite the one our cars face when parked It is a little cramped to say the least When trying to back out of the space I need to back up enough to not hit the car parked to the right of me before turning The gate I need to get out of is also to the right of me By the time I have backed out enough to avoid the other car there is hardly any space left before I would hit the wall behind me I have tried moving forward and backing up again several times because my ultimate goal is to back up to the left in order to go out through the gate to the right After multiple attempts at backing up and turning pulling forward backing up again turning again etc I still cant seem to get out of my space and facing the gate I do not know what else to do Ive backed my car into my spot a couple times admittedly it is a little easier than backing out but it is still hard I have parking sensors but they practically arent helpful in this situation because theyre so sensitive to anything Im close to First Im too close to the car parked next to me now Im too close to the wall etc I cant believe Im having this issue I went out there just now to try backing out just to get better at it but I actually gave up and went back inside This is not like me Im in my 30s and have been driving since I was a teenager The thing is I was pulling out this morning because I had backed in the night before and I was having similar trouble getting out of the spot Sometimes it seems like I actually do have a little more room than what the parking sensors are telling me I have so I very gently inched forward even though I was getting close to the wall I did in fact end up making contract with the wall and even though I was being very gentle and barely moving it did leave scratches So Im a little traumatized It never would have occurred to me before signing the lease that I would need to get out measuring tape in order to determine how easy it would be to park my car in this garage I have never had a problem like this before in my life I have no idea what to do at this point,No Idea What to Do About Parking Situation,507

3105,cars,I was wondering if i can get some advice on how AC repairdiagnostics work I bought my car a 2018 Honda accord in Q4 of 2018 sometime early 2020 the AC stopped blowing cold air but i was to lazy to get it looked at Until this past week the heatwave in the PNW made me get it checked So i have my car brought into the dealership where i bought it and i told them before they do any kind of work on it let me know what the issue is after their diagnostics Reason for this is because 1 I find it odd that a 2018 car would need to be recharged in a little over 2 years mentioned above cold air stopped working last year 2 because of part 1 im assuming its a defect or damage to a component which would suck but i believe my warranty will cover it and if so they will also cover recharging it with refrigerant 3 lastly if its simply a recharge issue they will charge me 280 to get it done if it turns out it simply needs to be recharged i was going to first ask them why would it require a recharge only 2 years later and lastly i was going to get it done at a local mechanic for cheaper but it turns out for diagnostics purposes they still have to charge it and im assuming they are going to charge me 280 for it still regardless is what they say true to do a full diagnosis does it have to be charged also does a full diagnosis take 35 hours their quoted time,I was wondering if i can get some advice on how AC repairdiagnostics work,278

3236,cars,I wanna know that if you can modify a car with popup headlights to a fixed headlights pair like the FCFD can you do the vice versa on a fixed headlight car Of course its just not any car But cars that can work well with popup headlights The factor that can make them work according to my knowledge on why they were invented is a slick design for aerodynamic purposes There are many cars that has this factor even today Like the Corvette LaFerarri Ford GT if you have more examples leave a comment With these 3 examples can we modify them to be fitted with popup headlights And what would it take to fit them with a pair But what about cars that dont have there slick and aerodynamic design Like the KE35 My theory would be to change the hood for a wedgelike shape change to a shorter size radiator and a front bumper swap Id swap it with a Trueno front bumper since the height of it is low enough for an aerodynamic hood design and because it would fit with the design of KE35 Also theyre both Corollas Please leave your answers thanks,Can you install popup headlights on a fixed headlights car,198

3270,cars,I am a 22 year old US male that just graduated with a Bachelors in a hard science I learned to drive an automatic at 16 with a lot of struggle I had a hard time learning to stay in a lane I did not manage turns very well etc It took me about six months of weekly practice until I passed my licensing test I never really recovered from this experience I recall my parents being frustrated with me and that everyone in high school was learning to drive seamlessly This was the first time in my life that I really realized how I simply wasnt good at something It took me six months to take my licensing test How embarassing In college I could not afford a car and I lived near campus I was studying most of the time and thus did not need a car I hated this and this not owning a car in college is easily the most shameful thing I have ever done A car is such a commonplace and ubiquitous item in the US particularly in the South where I live I graduated this past summer and obtained a handmedown 11 Accord I also got a job so I need the car This is my first time driving consistently and everyday I have been driving for three weeks I am deeply humiliated by the following I still feel uneasy changing lanes when the gap between me and the car on the other lane is small I sometimes wait for the gap to become much bigger than necessary I cannot change three lanes at once yet Everyone else can when on the Interstate I cannot Therefore I am an inadequate human I do not feel comfortable driving in the dark I use the freeway at onramps where I see that there are few vehicles on the road I have yet to use a freeway in the morning when it is backed up I have not done a roadtrip yet as I do not feel comfortable driving long distances I still get my back sweaty and my palms wet as I merge onto a busy interstate All the aforementioned points highlight why I am an embarassing human Ultimately to struggle in something so rudimentary as driving is disgusting It is bizarre and ugly No one else has had this hiccup in driving All other people simply learned it and went on to ride far and wide It is becoming increasingly hard for me to socialize with anyone in my personal or professional life after all these people likely had it easy learning to drive and do not share my story I purposely leave work after everyone else has left I do not want people seeing me drive I am scared of meeting anyone to date me or get to know me They will always have something over me they had it easier learning to drive and never had an iota of anxiety about it To know that this will forever be on my back and in my history makes me want to isolate myself from society Inexperienced drivers like me are scum and ugly Again everyone got over this at 16 I only got over this at 22 What a shame What kind of a man am I,What do you think of a new driver at 22,554

3285,cars,i have 0 fautual proof to back anything I say up so if Im wrong please correct me Im just basing my opinion off personal experience Like I dont get the point of having them on modern cars they are just asking for people to be dumb Im my 2 minutes of research I think that parking lights are intended for if you are parking on an unlit street so your car will be illuminated to prevent people from hitting it But why put the parking lights on the same switch as the low beams This is just asking for trouble and for people to turn the wrong set of lights on And not realise untill I almost hit them in the dark The first thing I learnt when I was doing a computer science course was assume the end user is going to be an idiot because most of the time they are So why do manufactures not put the logic into designing the light switch on a car Ive seen it moutned on the indicator or wiper stalks on the dash so they dont care where the switch is then why not separate the park light and low beam switches It would be such a simple design change that would make such a difference It is a real problem where I live newzeland look at my post history if u wnana find out what city because the streets are lit enought to see when its starting to get dark everyone is going home and its just about to be dark but there is still a bit of light so you cant quite tell if your low beams are on This post was caused by me driving past 4 people in a row with only there park lights on and then almost hitting someone Yes I get we could teach drivers better and to keep an eye out on this but Ive lost all hope that we can teach that to people so lets try design arround that Oh and English is my first language I just suck at spelling I know someone asked this question before but that was a year ago so I hope Im not breaking rule 10 if so sorry,Whats the point of parking lights,375

3394,cars,Alright so im trying to wrap my head around the purpose of double clutching yes I know you only NEED to double clutch in a car without a syncromesh Heres my understanding correct if im wrong finding a clear answer on google is hard You put your foot on the clutch disconnecting the clutch disc from the flywheel You then put it into neutral reconnecting the clutch disc but disconnecting the dog clutch and therefore the outputshaft from the now freewheeling gears Since the engine is idling unless reved up in neutral the input shaft layshaft and clutch dis are all spinning slowly in unison Furthermore the output shaft while still spinning at whatever speed the wheels are spinning at is slowing down You then put your foot back on the clutch pedal disconnecting the engine from transmission and select the gear engaging the dog clutch with the respective gear rev the engine and take your foot off the clutch So providing this is right is it the slowing down of the input shaft by extension the gears and output shaft and by extension dog clutches that allows the dog clutches to mesh with the gears and which part of the transmission does snyno rings slow,Question about double clutching,206

3617,cars,Ive bought quite a few cars off of Facebook and Craigslist but I have yet to negotiate with someone actually delusional on the value of their car For the most part people have been very grounded Today I messaged a guy with a 2011 Lancer ES blue booked at 6000 clean retail He had it listed for 6100 so I think “OK hes done his research and picked a good starting price to negotiate from” Based on pictures alone the exterior looked mint and interior was just a little dirty The kicker now is that it has a rebuilt title Just from googling the VIN I found the auction it was bought from and some before pictures It was in a wreck that totally destroyed the passenger side fender to fender Props to whoever fixed it up though So not knowing the extent of the damage to the frame or anything mechanical I message the guy “Based on pictures it looks really nice I really want to look at it in person but given the status of the title I wouldnt be able to offer you anywhere near your asking price Would you be willing to drop the price to somewhere in the 20003000 range I just dont want to waste your time knowing that I couldnt offer you as much as youd want “ His reply “This car is worth much more than I am asking If in a year or two If I dont sell it I might drop the price Thanks for the offer though” Im disappointed cause Ive always wanted a Lancer but Id be stupid to pay full price for anything other than a clean title right Im not the dick here right I would consider paying a bit more if the test drive went really well but the “This car is worth much more” is evidence that this guys going to be a pain to work with,Whats your best “I know what I got” story,323

3624,cars,hi Im a very enamoured owner of a 1999 20 138hp Ford Focus Wagon Ghia Its more of a handmedown from my parents since they got a new ca Its an incredibly responsive car its just as powerful as I need it has a beautiful interior since it was some sort of limited edition in its time and overall I feel like I can rely on it anytime Its amazing for road trips but there are some things I would like to fix now that I started making my own money the AC is broken I think it has been broken since my parents bought it from a shady ass dealer around 6 years ago with 900 EUR who also lied about the engine being 18 and my parents had an unpleasant surprise of having to pay a big ass tax for the actual engine of 20 they didnt know any better Anyway due to that my parents never managed to fix the AC my understanding is that the compressor is broken because it was quite expensive and they couldnt afford it at the time Other than that the cars been wellkept oil has always been changed in due time so has the timing belt and everything else that needed to be replaced other than the compressor Now that its summer this makes it very uncomfortable to drive it it has a manual transmission and in the last 6 months it started to be more difficult than usual to shift into 2nd gear It does go into it but you have to hold it so that it doesnt jump out of it I must mention this only happens in cold weather but not always As long as you hold it well and keep it there until it has actually gone into the gear its fine and it will stay there This doesnt happen with any other gear I was told its because of the shift rod really hope Im translating the things right english isnt my first language I was not told however if I need to change the whole damn transmission or if it even is possible to only change the shift rod I know mechanics as much as the next person dont judge me please Im guessing this could cause a big hole in my pocket it wont pass by the automotive register unless I fix the outside Theres some rust around the wheels not a lot really and the dye well its as good as it can be on a 22 year old car that has never had anything done to its exterior meaning that the colours washed out on the doors I guess you can imagine it doesnt look the greatest Because of these minor aesthetic issues Im basically running at risk of losing my certificate if Im ever caught by the automotive register on the street I was actually stopped once but the lady was nice and asked me if Im in a hurry I obviously said yes and let me leave I want to get rid of the rust and get a paint job same colour grey Besides the shift rod I know how much the other would cost me Its not that bad and by the end of the summer I will have the money Does this seem like a car worth fixing to you Am I running the risk of my entire transmission breaking guessing the answer is yes… I love this car so much that I think I will actually cry when I lose it and its part of the reason I want to get it all in order so I can safely have it for some more years Thanks,Is my Ford worth fixing,619

3716,cars,So today there was a confrontation between the police and some manifestants I was unlucky to be driving in the neighbourhood when it happened So all the cars were terribly slow barely moving due to the massive quantity of police wagons and blockade After around 20 minutes or more almost static I see the thermostat going up I try to turn the fan on then a smell of burnt stuff came straight in my face Apparently no smoke I park not long after thermostat on around 90⁰C Due to the seasonal heat the coolant tank remains hot even though all the rest including engine feels cool to touch after 2 hours I didnt try to open the coolant tank cap The traffic got better temperature is at 60⁰C I try to depart not even three minutes after the thermostat shows 80⁰C As suggested I turned on heating on max it kept the temperature below 80⁰C until I could return to the hotel Fan seems not to be working for starters Second if the temperature got high so fast maybe theres only gas inside the coolant system I dont see any leakage and the radiator was fixed three weeks ago What could it be Im letting the car cool completely overnight before opening the cap so Im already considering it might be dry due to the fast rise of temperature after I restarted I thank you in advance for your thoughts,What might be causing overheating,240
3719,cars,Its 8PM last night and its raining I need to take my dog to the emergency vet Im driving down the middle lane My turn is coming up and I need to get into the right lane I check my review sideview mirrors and the little blind spot mirror and see no headlights near me so I think Im clear Im about to move into the right lane when a minivan barrels past me with no lights on Im not pleased but its partially my fault since my instinct in low visibility conditions is to look for headlights instead of looking for cars with no headlights camouflaged by the rain and mist kicked up by my vehicle but I should know better I leave the vet at 9PM and need to make a left The sun has set now and its still raining Check to my right and its clear and the same with the left with the nearest headlights far far away I start making my turn and notice some of the headlights in the distance being blocked Luckily I was able to process it fast enough to mean there was something likely a vehicle blocking the headlights I narrowly avoided a Nissan with no lights on speeding past Im sick and tired of this Its gotten worse lately here in Florida now that were in part of the year that it rains almost everyday Its dark and pouring rain to the point where you can only see 100200 feet Should I turn my headlights on No its 3PM and thats not headlight time I figure thats whats running through peoples heads because I cant figure out another logical explanation I shouldnt have to play Hubble Telescope trying to find a planet by detecting the slight decrease in luminosity from a star when the planet crosses in front of it People are unwilling andor unable to do something as simple as turning on their headlights so the only alternative I can see is to take the decision out of their hands by having always on lights or having lights permanently fixed to a light sensor,Always on or sensordriven headlights should be mandatory,356

3951,cars,Hard to explain but my car feels and drives absolutely fine and I had very very rarely heard any noise from transmission before very occasionally Recently now I have noticed it will clickclunk a lot more often usually after a shift in weight or load For instance reversing off my driveway sometimes will make the transmission clunkclick quietly one time and then again when I put it in D and drive up the street only when I turn my wheels and start moving not the shifting if gears itself It seems from a stop occasionally and increasingly frequently compared to a few months back it will clickclunk the one time after a shift in weight or something I suspect something to do with transmission mount Here is the scary part though Regular driving and shifting makes no noise but my reasoning for making this post come from when I had the car in reverse and it started rapidly clicking Like a very weirdfeint clicking or rattling noise only in reverse I feared it was rod knock so I turned it off but I then realized after turning it on that it was only in reverse And after driving away in D and parking to test reverse again the rapid clicking stopped I am not sure what could cause this but as it is so situational and seems to do with weight transferrance I am hoping tranny mount No clunking when I start stop aggressively only when the vehicle is from a standstill and moves abruptly or when it shifts a little roughly and jolts the car a tad Any ideas Obviously will take to a mechanic forst thing tmo,2015 VW Jetta transmission occasionally clickingclunking Reverse gear rattle,279
3956,cars,So I have a 2009 Nissan Maxima SV that was given to me by my mom and her boyfriend weve had it for years and its always had an overheating problem until they took it to this place that managed to fix it Well eventually it came back but it would only overheat when you were speeding down the highway flooring it Eventually I figured out the radiator hose was collapsed and a week or 2 ago I took it to pepboys to get them to replace the radiator hose replace the thermostat change the transmission fluid and flush and change the coolant They did all that and when I got it back it was over heating even worse I theorized that they mightve gotten air in my coolant which they did and they fixed for free Now that Ive gotten it back its still over heating after driving it for a while but cools down when the engine is revved when idling or if I floor it while driving however it shortly starts to rise again I have no clue what it could be I replaced the radiator cap with the exact same one that was already there with no issues weve had the coolant flushed and theres no discoloration so far there was a whining noise most likely from the air inside the coolant and the CVT needing trans fluid but its gone now theres no leaks or smoke coming from the engine no check engine light we had the oil changed not too long ago and the coloroil level is fine the radiator fan turns on and we had the thermostat replaced Weve taken it back to pepboys because theyre doing this for free since its whatever they did that started it to overheat badly As I said before it only overheated when I was seriously pushing the car literally going the top speed and it only happened once now after fixing the issues that should make it over heat whatever they did made it worse I thought maybe it was the temperature sensor but I have no idea does anyone know what it could be Has anyone else had the same or a similar problem with their maxima or any car Any help is appreciated,2009 Nissan Maxima SV overheating problem after many attempts of fixing,379

4083,cars,Wow what an incredibly amazing car Even in base form no options except I think they had the optional sport exhaust I loved just about everything about this car The traction was unreal the transmission was nearly flawless and it just felt so lightweight and joyful to drive But to make things simple I figured I would just post the Ups and the Downs if you will Positive Points 1 Amazing traction acceleration feels almost like a 4wd car off the line 2 Amazingly good ride with the stock suspension shockingly good very compliant on rough surfaces nothing like what I remember the C7 being I have no idea if the magride option makes the ride harsher but I loved the stock suspension 3 Transmission was excellent in low speed nearly invisible when daily driving and incredibly responsive when pushed hard It very rarely had a semiharsh shift but nothing outrageous 4 I averaged 25 mpg over about 1000 miles which was impressive given how hard I was pushing the car though the majority of our driving was just freeway cruising at 80 mph Negative Points 1 Getting in and out of this car was a real pain I feel like you really have to twist a full 90 degrees while seated to get out as opposed to other cars its more like 2030 degrees The side rocker panels are so thick that you really have to extend your legs over them to get inout For reference Im 160 pounds and 6 tall but I do have long legs so maybe that was a factor 2 The rear view mirror camera only available on 2LT iirc is basically a necessity in my eyes I was driving this car in Arizona which is no where near as cramped as where I live Los Angeles and even in wide open AZ I was constantly worried about hitting pedestrians or other cars when reversing That rear mirror camera feature should be included in all models in my opinion 3 The base 1LT interior felt a little cheap but honestly it didnt bother me personally it did bother my partner though 4 It was very quiet even with the sport exhaust I didnt mind that at all I love a classy quiet car but it was even quieter than my completely stock e55 Amg which can be a turn off for some 5 The roof panel emanated quite a bit of heat from the outside so I dont know how good that would feel in a hot AZ summer but it was nice weather and even still it was noticeable Overall Wow what a car even in completely base trim It felt lightweight fun to drive great gas mileage and an interior that I would have no problem living with every day It really lives up to everything we were hoping for when we think of affordable V8 Midengine cars I know everyone loved the C7 and I did too but I have to admit that the C8 is just so much better in so many ways that I still think about how fun it was to drive I cant wait to see what the Z06 is like,I rented a totally base C8 for a weekend and here are my thoughts,534

4089,cars,First apologies for opening another post but i created quite a bit confusion in previous one by not explaining properly what i mean and mentioning turbo which im not even sure my car has so let me rephrase myself but first let me say thank you to all those who tried to help with my badly worded question I recently bought a brand new Hyundai i30 n line 16 mild hybrid and since im not an auto wizz and am used to driving only old cars i dont really know a few things about it Mostly am curious about this question tho which is Sometimes when i drive from a complete stop or from coasting at low speeds when i hit gas in second or third gear i hear i think from the back of my car a really satisfying a bit faded sound that goes like psssssst as i speed up Kinda sounds like a nitro from need for speed games heh I wonder what exactly makes that sound and HOW do i make it whenever i want because it only happens sometimes and im not sure what my inputs are when it does happen but i want to know how to produce it whenever i want and know what excatly makes it Thanks again,What is that satisfying sound and why does it happen,216

4204,cars,So the long and short of it is Ive had a vibration in my Crosstour for about a year now Started off barely noticeable and has gotten progressively worse I feel it not so much in the wheel but in the drivers seat and rear of the car I took it to a Honda specialist and they diagnosed and said it was the drivetrain That cost a pretty penny they installed today and just now I got the unfortunate phone call that replacing the drivetrain did not fix the vibration He speculates that perhaps over the course of time it has affected my rear axles He said its quite pricey to do that sort of diagnostics going to a drivetrain specialist and often times replacing them is best to save money Shocked I said “and what if the problem persists” Well Im sure you can figure out what his response was and now hes going to take my car to another place he works closely with to see if they can figure out whats wrong He said he was shocked that the new drivetrain didnt correct the problem and hes going to try to make things right Any thoughts or comments on how to proceed or any similar situation out there would be appreciated,2012 Honda Crosstour Drivetrain Issues,214

4222,cars,Hi all I come to you with a warning pertaining to GMs dfm andor auto stopstart on their latest model trucks My fathers 2021 Silverado Trailboss suddenly shut off on him the other day a block from the house after the auto stopstart kicked in and had to be towed to the dealership Upon inspection at least one or the complex lifters used for cylinder deactivation has collapsed with more than one being a possibility The truck had around 6000 miles on it and hasnt even gotten its first oil change Now I know that seems like a lot of miles on the original oil but the dealership did not say to my father whether or not the original oil needs to be changed sooner than the truck calls for it to be I find it a bit upsetting that after having this cylinder shut off and auto stopstart tech for a good margin of time that GM still hasnt been able to find a way to make it reliable This is a warning that these lifters are still prone to collapsing resulting in either an engine rebuild or a whole new block It seems logical to me that if something like this has a high chance of failure that it shouldnt be implemented or it is working flawlessly enough that failure is an anomaly Good engineering shouldnt be rushed but should be given as much time as is needed to make something great the first round,Warning about GMs dfm cylinder shut off from recent experience,247

4653,cars,EDIT IM IN THE USA Ive been browsing the used car market for several months and the thing Ive always heard was that manuals are always cheaper usually followed up by and theyre better on gas which I had originally ate up before I started searching for one but Ive been searching for several months now and manuals seem to be anywhere from 15x more expensive up to 3x more expensive Using a 3g eclipse as an example I see the automatic transmission models sell for 2000 while comparable manual variants will sell for 3500 to 4000 which is insane to me why would I bother with the 3g when I could just get a 4g GT in manual for like 6000 and just take up payments for a car thats going to be infinitely more fun look better and have more power Recently my cousin has started looking for a car so I decided to search for some cars with auto transmissions and I was just tripping over running and driving cars with missing body panels or have dents and scratches but otherwise be in proper running condition 700 to 1000 meanwhile all youll find in manual for that price is a body with no motor thats completely rusted into the ground so what gives Why are manuals much more expensive and why do people think theyre actually cheaper Ive never seen a manual in my time searching sell for less than an auto Ive just never seen it,Ive always heard manuals are cheaper but from what Ive seent this just doesnt seem to be the case,250

4701,cars,What is everyones opinion as to when car supply normalizes again Used and new I have the impression that as soon as the chip shortage gets under control most manufacturers will ramp up production and new car supply will normalize over the following 3 month or so So assuming the chip shortage is sorted out in the next 36 month I would expect there to be a normal supply of new cars again starting sometime between Jan to April of 2022 For used cars its a bit harder to say as I am not sure about all the demand factors driving the current price runup The most obvious one is that people didnt need a car last year saved some money and now need to commute or drive for work again But I suspect there are other factors like people panic buying or trying to flip cars in teh current environment Hard to say when that will let off My best guess would be 2 to 4 month following the normalization of new car supply so maybe around this time next year What is eveyone elses take on this,Timeframe for Used and New Car Supply Normalization,189

4787,cars,Sorry if this is a stupid question but Im shopping around for front suspension components for my 2001 GS430 and many brands Ive never even heard of make cheap replacement parts that are cheaper than buying directly from Lexus Are they bad or is the quality difference negligible Is there a stark difference in build quality Im wondering what are the exact differences between off brand parts and OEM parts in general From my understanding nice aftermarket parts that are intended to be better than OEM spec tend to be made from stronger and lighter materials and depending on the part can be adjustable Is it worth paying more for directfrommanufacture OEM parts Thanks for reading ,What specifically is different in the quality of OEM parts vs aftermarket replacement parts on cars in general,116

4804,cars,no this isnt a paid ad or a shill A month or so ago I discovered this website which is an umbrella search site that lets you look for cars for sale across a large number of individual car sales websites There are other sites with a similar idea I used to use one for nationwide craigslist searches that was wonky but autotempest is the best Ive seen at solving this problem very powerful search criteria often more powerful than the underlying source websites Ive spent the last few months searching for a used car in that sweet spot too old to be CPO new enough to have modern tech and not be thrashed I found my car via autotempest and pulled the trigger and couldnt be happier a story for another post In my case there were a particular set of options I was looking for and it was quite tedious to monitor multiple sites and try to weed out the cars I wasnt interested in but autotempest made it easy to craft a search that trawled all the cars for sale online well maybe not all but a very very large number of them making it easy to find the one with the configuration I wanted Their craigslist integration can be improved not sure how much is under their ability to control and how much is limited by craigslist APIs or data scraping Hours of entertainment even if you arent actually buying and just like seeing whats out there,my new favorite website autotempestcom,251

5040,cars,with all the family cars that i have had they came in as not too noisy or silent while being driven then about 5 years later they start to make reasonably loud noise like creaking and rumbling is there a bad practice that we are used to doing without knowing that it is damaging to the car only bad thing that i can think of is pulling the handbrake all the way up even when the car is not parked on a hill going to a mechanic usually just provides a temporary fix which doesnt even fix it entirely im saying this from my perspective of a passenger in a family car i havent gotten around to driving and maintaining a car that much but there must be something dumb we are doing with the car unless if they are all suppose to get squeakyweirdly noisy over 6 years,why do gas cars eventually start making noise during driving,149

5087,cars,I think reviews are only useful if they are fair and there are enough of them so people can see different perspectives I sold a car to Vroom a couple of days ago and I think the experience is positive Plus Price was 12 and 6 more than what Carvana and Carmax offered I think I can get the same from selling to private party which usually much more work Straightforward process although not as simple as Carvana or Carmax Direct bank transfer option certainly better than a check Minus Minimal communication I emailed them and never get answer back although the needle did move every time I emailed them The whole process took 3 weeks so if you r in a hurry its not for you 3rd party car transportation I see some risk there although the guy was super nice Heres the timeline agree on price they send and you sign online paperwork 1 day they send you physical paperwork after 3 days it took 2 days for paperwork to arrive i sign the paperwork send it back together with my title Takes 2 days for my paperwork to reach them they then assign transportation it took the transportation company 1 week to pick up i submit bill of lader right after the pick up i receive money in my account 2 days after the pick up I feel if all stars line up you can have your money within 1 week but my timeline is probably typical with small hiccups here and there It is not the best “do nothing” deal as Carvana offered but for a few more steps I have 2500 more in my bank account I would do it again 10 times Also I saw the car listed today for only 11 more than what they paid me It was an amazing car but their margin is so thin I guess because they r trying to build their market You guys should take advantage of this if u r selling your car now,Sold a car to Vroom Positive,339

5126,cars,Audi A1 2017 playe UK Had the car since February A week or so ago I suddenly noticed my revs fly up to 5 6k whilst in 5th gear at 45mph I changed to 6th and no issue on way home Since then issue has got slightly more regular with 3rd and upwards gears all causing revs to fly up suddenly especially when going uphill I have become more able to control it through not accelerating uphil and more forceful but slower gear changes eg moving from 3rd to 4th slowly but powerfully moving the gearstick into 4th to make sure it slots in Clearly something is wrong and I have read that a new clutch can cost 1k for this car so hopefully someone can either put me out of my misery or provide another possible cause that wont cause me sleepless nights I thought I was a good driver until I read posts saying holding your clutch down at traffic lights and driving in too high a gear could cause damage I had no idea about either nobody had ever told me I presumed holding clutch down fully was fine as its fully engaged But then again Ive only had the car for 4 months so how much damage could that have really done I had my last car for 3 years and no issue Any advice etc much appreciated thanks,Suspected slipping clutch unsure,233

5142,cars,sorry I have to be general but I picked up a turbo setup for my engine and it has engine management with the correct tune on it and wiring that matches the wrong year engine 05 06 instead of 07 08 09 10 so I finally found the right boomslang and tried it on the car and it wont start just cranks a bunch then has a small putt of firing and dies but it turns out the wiring is for an AEM EMS2 and I have an AEM EMS1 AEM is a shitshow as far as support to match the pinouts the kit and presumably the tune is for RC Injectors 750cc and an descendant aftermarket rail and the stockers are like 310cc I figured since you dont see boost at idle like that then it should run it at least enough to verify that the wiring works looking at the wires MOST of the wires look right car is a 91 MR2,Can wildly different injectors prevent a car from starting,164
5144,cars,It seems like European trucks and buses automaker particularly DaimlerAG Traton Scania and Man Volvo Trucks and Buses and to a lesser extent IvecoCNH Industrial dominate around the world in terms of sales figures revenues and profits We all hear about Americans love affair with trucks particularly domestic But even in North America Daimler owns Freightliner Western Star and Detroit Diesel while Volvo owns Mack and Prevost Buses and NavistarInternationals biggest shareholder is Traton Thus the only American manufacturer is PACCAR which doesnt seem to quite match the size and sheer domination of the three Europeans Of course in terms of the sheer number of trucks and chassis sold Ford is number in the world with the best selling FSeries but it isnt officially considered or recognized as heavy commercial because its a pickup as much Just for another comparison Japanese truck manufacturer IsuzuUD and Toyotas own Hino also doesnt quite match up to the Europeans Third manufacturer Mitsubishi Fuso is again owned by Daimler As for the Koreans more or less same story Daewoo Trucks is owned by Tata now and Hyundai commercial trucks and buses are even smaller player than some Chinese Russian and Indian manufacturer also pulled out of North American market So my questions are 1Why do European makes dominate the heavy commercial trucks and buses industry all around the world Is it due to EU government incentives 2 Why isnt Ford FSeries or Chevy Silverados and such officially considered heavy commercial trucks Is it because its a pickup and many people also buy it for personal use 2Finally doesnt the fact that American heavy industry corporations like Freightliner Western Star Mack and Detroit Diesel being owned by foreign entity technically pose a national security issue,Why do European makes dominate the heavy commercial trucks and buses industry all around the world,290

5172,cars,I drive a 2002 Toyota Highlander When I was taught to drive I wasnt told about engine braking or how the overdrive worked etc Our regular commute doesnt have extreme inclinesdeclines and I never spent the time to research this on my own since to be frank I had no idea it existed However I was flipping through the owners manual and discovered how the 2 and L gears worked along with the OD off button and engine braking But tbh now Im confused From what I can tell engine braking isnt going to destroy my transmission as long as I do it correctly Im not shifting into L while going 50 mph But I just want to make sure Im doing this right Please forgive me if Im doing something wrong everything I know is from reading countless internet articles If I want to use engine braking when going down a steep hill I 1 take my foot off the accelerator 2 shift into the appropriate gear going down one by one not shifting all at once Also if the engine braking is a little too much is it okay for me to push the gas pedal a little to stay at a comfortable speed I just want to avoid the awkward back and forward of hitting the brake pedal to slow down then releasing to not overheat repeat Id much rather a smooth and constant rate of descent Plus it appears that engine braking helps me save fuel does me pushing the gas pedal a little bit while engine braking cancel this effect out Again I just want to keep a steady speed when going down steep declines Last question the Highlander has an overdriveoff button Now from what I know this should be used if Im towing heavy loads or going up a steep hill My question is do I need to take my foot off the gas when I push this button whether Im turning OD off or on since its shifting gears or is the overdrive different from the other gears Is it okay for me to just leave my foot on the gas when I turn it onoff Again sorry if this is a stupid question I just want to make sure Im doing this right,Engine Braking and Overdrive,382

5201,cars,I currently have a 2001 BMW 330i that I just took into the shop from leaking coolant and was told I need a new thermostat and radiator fan clutch Their quote was about 1260 Im conflicted if I should shell out more money into this car or just try and sell it and get a more reliablecheaper to repair car The KBB value is about 2500 in good condition 3500 to private sellers Literally about a month ago I decided to put 3k into the car thinking I could get at least 12 more years out of it without anything major going wrong I replaced all of the brake padsrotors new radiator front control arm and valve cover gasket Not to mention all of the notorious window regulators that went bad and a serpentine belt several years ago Now Im wishing I could go back and just use that as a down payment on a new car The car has about 97000 miles on it and looks great but there is still a small oil leak and power steering fluid leak that needs to be addressed AC is a little weak imo I need new tires and the wiper fluid container is crumbling causing the liquid to evaporate I am thinking Before the 3k repair my mechanic told me it would be hard to get any car close to how nice this BMW is with what I could sell it for and then buy But Im now feeling like this a ticking time bomb with more repairs to come and will be the more expensive route long term Do I cut my losses,Should I repair my BMW or sell it,273

5210,cars,This searing hot take brought to you from the drivers seat of a black Dodge Ram 57 litre at the Wendys drivethrough my white oakleys are riding high and my camera angle is low New and used car prices are spiking because supply is low and demand is high So why is demand high Are all the new and used car buyers desperately shopping because the transmission finally failed on their 300000 mile 2008 Malibu I somehow doubt it I think it is more likely that most people dont need a new car they just really really want one and are prepared to YOLO paying over sticker paying huge markups financing for 84 96 or 108 months etc I think a lack of impulse control and excellent rationalization skills are more to blame than a temporary lack of supply It is almost always cheaper to fix your existing car than buy a new one Ive got a collection of all the stuff you arent supposed to buy to the point where even Tyler Hoover would be nervous and Scotty Kilmer would be twitching on the pavement foaming at the mouth and mumbling Celica over and over And over the past few years not one of them even the 2009 Cayenne GTS with 300000 km has come close to the cost of buying and running a new car any new car Im not saying anyone should run out and buy a 2003 BMW 745i and give their local Midas or Jiffy Lube a blank cheque but maybe just maybe you dont need to trade in your 2012 Tacoma with 120000 miles just because it doesnt smell new anymore and it might need a brake job in the next few months,I dont really have any pity for people forced to overpay for new or used cars the last few months,289

5233,cars,Posted this to another sub earlier but figured Id try here as well I just got this car in November 2020 Im the second owner it was originally a lease It only has 27400 miles on it Within the past week I started feeling and hearing a clicking and jerking in the steering wheel when turningcorrecting instead of a smooth transition This is worse on the highway and the car has been difficult to keep straight at speeds greater than 50 mph I brought it to the dealership today and was told the power steering rack is failing and needs to be replaced Google searching and a few NHTSA complaints Ive found tell me Im not the first person to experience this but needless to say Im furious and extremely disheartened A car thats only 3 years old should NOT have a failing power steering rack Has anyone else had this happen Does anyone know how common this problem isif it is something that tends to happen repeatedly or is it generally a onetime fix,2018 Honda Civic LX power steering rack failing and needs replacement,175
5265,cars,Okay so Carscoops decided to be a bunch of madmen and leak the new second generation Lexus NX This actually wasnt the first time that it happened Three months ago I revealed that an independent YouTube channel then followed by a bunch of other YouTube channels leaked the new Lexus NX Thanks to Carscoops theyve confirmed everything that Ive said previously in the previous post And um I watched both of the videos and I was so FUCKING blown away from both of the videos and the second generation Lexus NX For me the first generation NX is one of the least memorable cars that Lexus has ever built ever But from the rumors I knew this new one was going to tear a way bigger hole in the competition than it did before and holyyy fuck it was true This new NX is pretty nuts The first video is just a general introduction to the car and gives you a taste of the design I personally hated the odd overbite the old one had and the uninspiring interior it had This new one is truly at the front of the pack in terms of interior and exterior design Also look at the badge nomenclature NX350 It looks like there is an allnew engine and my gut says its the rumored 24L turbocharged fourcylinder engine that should be in every way better than the old 20L While the first video is cool and all I think its going to be this next video that will probably break rCars This is the first ever plugin hybrid Lexus the NX450h This has been patented for a long ass time We know that h stood for hybrid so it was reasonable to think that the nomenclature signified that it was a plugin hybrid rather than a selfcharging hybrid And yes it uses the RAV4 Prime power unit But again youve expected that Ive also told yall to expect this The allnew redesigned and reimagined infotainment system brought to you by Lexus To me from looking at the video this is the best infotainment system on the market Its such a trick system and the maps are so crisp too I personally thought their older infotainment graphics wasnt bad so naturally this just blew me the fuck away to another dimension The NX allows you to configure your interior lighting colors in every single way which is something seen in more expensive cars The new infotainment system also allows you in creating your own profile for your car with a digital key access as well Overall the infotainment looks really intuitive and easy to use The most revolutionary part for me that I havent seen any manufacturer do see guys Lexus can and does innovate is that theyve allowed you to easily enable or disable any particular safety and assistance as you choose seen at 325 This infotainment system will be in every other Lexus as well AFAIK the next new Lexus to be released is the LX so it should have all of this new tech Im not sure if they can put this tech into some of their current cars but well see It looks like for cars like the LC and LS it will require an all new generation given how the interior is designed So what do you guys think We dont fully know powertrain specs yet particularly for the NX350 but my guess is 300 horsepower but well see in just under a day EDIT I just hope the leaked videos dont get taken down LOL,The 2022 Lexus NX has been leaked AGAIN,597

5308,cars,I have always loved a good sleeper build Something about a stock looking minivan wagon or old honda hiding a huge turbo or LS that can beat down any performance car on the street or track is awesome to me With the rise of electric cars normal passenger cars are coming out with power levels that put gas performance cars to shame That combined with instant torque and no shifting makes them so much quicker than most decent sleeper builds The way I see it a sleeper build would only make sense if it can still beat the average performance car while still looking like a stock slow car This would push the demands of an effective sleeper to need either close to 1000 hp or an electric swap to stay competitive with a base level Tesla What do you guys think Are sleeper builds on their way out Or is everything going to be Tesla swapped in the future,Are sleeper builds going to be obsolete in the future,160

5496,cars,I did post this in rJeep because I saw a commercial calling a Jeep an SUV and I am old TLDR if youre casually talking about your Wrangler to someone would you call it a truck or SUV Because its marketed and called an SUV but Ive never heard a Jeep owner in 40 years that would call it anything but a truck I bought my Jeep when I think it would have been defined as a light truck as squirrely as it was pulling people out of snow I agree There was another thread I commented in regarding how sexy the sport 4 door cherokee was back in the day vs whether it would sell in todays market and it just depressed me about the difference between cars doing their car brand thing vs big business ruining everything with these terms But the Cherokee was considered the first SUV according to wikipedia AmericanEnglishAmericanEnglish I think the Defender was unibody construction its not clear if the Cherokee was and its also not clear if that matters for SUV designation Now My YJ is apparently not a truck because it got swallowed up by the assumption it is an SUV when its actually completely both The evidence is that Jeep used the term SUV in a commercial I just saw and it sorta surprised me Maybe this is a philosophical conversation about marketing If so Ill kill myself LOL In my mind the SUV term only gained momentum when minivans became square and they needed the same soccer mom car with panache I hate that Jeep made really bad soccer mom cars at the expense of the brand standard ESPECIALLY IN LIEU OF THE FACT that the automakers who will survive electrification and autonomy will be niche brands with a message to sell and Jeep watered theirs down Big time Its like VW killing the Eurovan Vanagon for a soccer mom Touareg Historians are going to say yeah they killed their brand promise and destroyed part of their future market in the long term for faddish and trending short term profits of course none of these companies could really see the sea change ahead of them I just know it I know these marquee brands can bring back the storied message of what makes the brand special but by then it may be too late But for the reddit community here What is your difference between a truck or SUV are they often the same thing and what are some good examples of one the other or both I sound needy,So you describe a Jeep to someone Do you call it a truck or SUV,430

6050,cars,President of Bugatti since January 2018 In the 35 years that he has been president the number of Bugatti models has quadrupled Since 2005 Bugatti has made 5 models without counting all the VeyronChiron special trims 3 of those were made after he took office Those are the Divo the Centodieci and La voiture noire They are all Chirons basically Yes they are tuned differently and they supposedly have different purposes But lets not kid ourselves they are Chirons And thats really my problem I feel like Winkelmann has been watering down the brand Yes every single one of the models that were introduced after he became president is a very low production one of them unique ultra exclusive car Personally though i think a big part of Bugattis appeal is that they make one model at a time That feels special somehow They are not really trying to address a certain market they just make one product A good product If you want it you get it And thats how it worked Yes the Veyron had many special editions but they were all clearly Veyrons with cosmetic changes excluding the SS and the Grand Sport The same cant be said about the Chirons cousins And thats what happened after Winkelmann came on board from Lamborghini where they make a new version or special edition for everything and they do it often And he doesnt even hide the fact that they do it just to make a profit Of course what he says is that with these special cars we can keep doing business and keep the lights on or something like that I dont feel like thats the kind of logic that matches Bugattis image I know what youll say They have to pay the bills Sure they do But they can also charge literally as much as they want and people will pay it They are rich after all I am not a businessman I am not the president of Bugatti I cannot afford one and i dont think i will be able to in the near future at least lol But as a car enthusiast i cant help but feel like the Bugatti brand is being watered down Evolution some will call it Sure But it has me worried regardless I also forgot to mention the Bolide but i think its different enough to not fit in with the rest as a Chiron clone How do you feel about this whole thing,Stephan Winkelmanns Bugatti,415

6130,cars,So there were 2 recall notices for this model and also I had 4 dashboard lights that all came in around the same time the engine light the ABS light the tire pressure light and a light that just says BRAKE in red letters So I brought it in to get this all fixed and they also replaced my AC filter 1800 1 They said the thermostat was buggy and that caused the engine light and so they replaced that 492 2 And the tire pressure sensor was buggy so they replaced that 441 3 And the BRAKE and ABS light was from the brake fluid level sensor so they replaced that 274 3 They did an oil and filter change 74 4 Air filter for AC 81 5 Cabin air filter 199 6 Rear brake pads were worn down so they replaced that 346 Maybe I missed something but anyway it was like 1800 Whatever I hadnt had any problems in a long time However that was a month ago and now 2 of the fucking lights are back on engine light and ABS light and my left headlight has turned off I just brought it back in and they said 1 The engine light is from the oil leaking onto the oil filter adapter so this will cost 1500 to replace 2 The ABS light actually turned off a few days ago so I dunno we are ignoring that for now I guess 3 The headlight bulb is out so that needs to be replaced 500 total the bulb cost 300 4 Also my fucking Freon is apparently leaking now so they need to plug that up or whatever for my AC 700 So in other words I brought it in to fix 4 dashboard warning lights a month ago spent 1800 and then within a week 2 of those come back on and a week later my headlight stops working and apparently my AC is leaking Freon and it will cost 2700 MORE to fix And how do I know this shit wont happen again in 2 weeks So is this just something normal that can just happen if youre unlucky or am I getting scammed And do I have any other options I guess I could bring it to a mechanic and see what theyd charge,Am I getting screwed by my dealership or am I just unlucky I brought my 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee in for repairs and now have more problems,390

6156,cars,My car hasnt been working for about 2 months and last month I posted a lot about it on this sub and had some people look at it and we all suspected it was an issue with the ECM I went to junkyard pulled the part carried to someone to program and install it and it wasnt the issue 300 bucks down the drain and month later im here again because the shop who programmed the computer sold me a 13 page PDF that describes my codes and the diagnostic procedure Among the first steps listed on page 5 is to check the harness connectors M223 F53 and M229 F66 As the shop explained to me they believe theres a short in one of the wires and a harness is burnt up they gave me 2 options 1 I can pay them to check the wires and if there is a frayshort pay them to run a wire directly from the pedal to ECM 2 I can pay them to chase the wires from the APP to see where the harness connector is and then pay to fix it They told me option 1 was cheaper and not guaranteed to work whereas option 2 was expensive but the most likely way to fix the car they told me no documentation exists online for my car to see where the harness connector from the APP to the ECM is and sold me a PDF from the manufacturer that has as much information about this issue as possible which i linked above Since I just paid a lot of money and they know im broke they told me if I can read the document and find the wiring harness myself i can save the 100hr it would take to pay someone to find it for me When I looked at the wiring diagram on Page 10 though i see the wires hooked up in the harness M229 but I dont see any indication of where that harness may be Im really hoping someone can help me out Im really strapped for cash right now and my savings are nearly running dry trying to fix this My hope is that someone can tell me where the Harness M229 F53 goes to andor help me make sense of this whole issue,Does anyone know how to find the harness connector that goes from the APP to the ECM Codes P0226 P0227 2002 Infiniti i35,387

6437,cars,Hill starts are still hard to do whats the best method for the learners to use My instructor told me to use the handbrake push in accelerator to get to 2k rpm and then release the clutch slowly to get to the biting point and feel the car slightly raised up in the front it worked well in their small car But in my car I still roll back using this method until my mother showed me her way using the brake pedal instead of handbrake which Im not ready yet She got the rev high to around between 5k and 6k and the car moved forward quicker without jerking forward which always happens to me I realised I was always scared to get the rev too high causing the damage to the clutch and engine Is it bad to get the rev too high to take off from the hill or should I stop worrying too much,Im learning to drive manual,158

6481,cars,My car Hyundai i30 has a mechanical speedometer and a digital one on the HUD screen where you can display different metrics about the car For some reason when driving uphill the digital and mechanical speedometers disagree Driving up a 20 ish degree incline the speedometer shows 80kmh and the digital one shows 74 I couldnt find any references as to why this is My guess is that the digital speedometer uses GPS to determine speed meaning that the digital reading is smaller because it only takes into account the horizontal component of speed while the mechanical one shows the actual speed with reference to the road This is a conundrum for me because my friend a long time driver said that I should trust the digital reading because if my speed was measured by police they would arrive at the result shown by the digital meter so even if it looked like I was speeding on the mechanical speedometer this is not the case Any thoughts Why do the speedometers disagree I wonder what the mechanism behind this is and if there is any further reading,Does the speedometer show the wrong speed when driving uphill,187

6608,cars,Ive just seen a teaser from MKBHD doing the new electric F150 review And nothing against him hes a great bloke but since when should the tech channels have the priority for EV reviews I mean the reviewers are usually very narrowly focused theres almost no comparison with any ICE cars and the videos just seem to be showcasing the tech gimmicks and no daytoday stuff if you know what I mean The videos also seem to be very PRish in a sense that reviewers dont seem to criticize the vehicles too much and are like ooohhh this thing is sooo cool Now for some drone shots Zack from JerryRigEverything is another example again great guy when he got the Hummer EV a while ago I mean sure those guys have a great way with tech but shouldnt we leave the reviews to the guys and gals who have been in the business for years or decades Or at least not make the first impressions exclusive to one group and not the other I get that they try to target us the younger audience but Im interested if anybody feels the same,Is anyone else annoyed by tech channels being prioritized for the EV reviews,192

6634,cars,What is going on with used hot hatch prices For example Im seeing 20182019 Civic Type Rs and Golf Rs going for just under to above their initial MSRPs despite having 10K 15K even more than 20K miles Why would somebody spend that money when a 2018 GLA 45 AMG the only hot MB hatch the US gets with similar miles goes for the same if not less money and is a more luxurious and faster vehicle Lets take a 2018 GLA 45 AMG and a 2018 Golf R DCT If they have similar maintenance histories and similar miles there are GLAs going for 38K and Golfs going for 3841K Although the MB would have higher average maintenance costs they likely wouldnt be more than the 3K that youd save by getting the GLA Why are used hot hatches simply not depreciating This seems to be confined to the hot hatch market in particular and I cannot understand why theyre not depreciating even moderately,What is going on with used hot hatch prices,164

7091,cars,I just did an oil change on my 01 Subaru Forester and its probably the easiest oil change ever it literally took 10 minutes The engine is so far forward and the car has so much ground clearance that I dont even need to jack the car up I can just lay on the ground and easily reach the drain plug and oil filter theres nothing in the way The drain plug is very low and the filter is in the front of the engine completely unobstructed by anything But I have heard of some modern cars where you have to take off plastic panels the filter is buried behind the suspension and exhaust the drain plug points directly at a cross member that acts like a spoon under a faucet and sprays oil everywhere etc What are your experiences,What is the easiest or hardest oil change you know of,140

7104,cars,My car is well maintained and most of the miles were put on by my dad driving from central Wisconsin to Chicago for work The AC works perfectly fine once I put my foot down and get it up to 6000 RPM but that means its blowing warm air until I make it to the onramp and I can do it without making myself look like a tool I took it to my dealer and the compressor and the AC unit itself are working fine I paid for a recharge and that didnt fix it They dont know whats wrong and I cant find anyone online thats had something similar happen Anyone have any insight,2014 Lexus ES350 175000 miles AC only works after reaching 6000 RPM at least once during my drive,115
7114,cars,At around the same time Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking was trying to shoot the moon by acquiring the muchlarger VW and people were watching debtfueled home prices continue to trace a parabola engineers at Porsche decided to put a 6speed manual transmission into a big heavy SUV and infuse as much handling into it as possible with an uprated highrevving NA V8 that breathed out through a throaty exhaust and optional PDCC to keep it flat in corners In doing so they also kept the Cayennes lowrange transfer case which meant that you could choose to either hit 15mph or 60 mph while in 3th gear 4k rpm Porsche had further blazed new paths in the sports SUV genre it invented Unfortunately in many ways the Cayenne GTS 6speed marked both the apogee and end of an era It was introduced in spring 2008 by the end of the year the financial crisis had begun By spring 2009 in the depths of a housing jobs and stock market crisis far fewer people could afford highend sports SUVs A new presidential administration placed greater emphasis on fuel economy adding commercial impetus to growing stigma around gasguzzling SUVs Within 5 years even the venerable BMW M3 would sport a turbo part of a trend that saw almost every vehicle with sporting aspirations replace engine displacement with forced induction hybrid versions would follow At the same time manual transmissions increasingly were replaced by various new automatics even in enthusiast cars the last Ferrari manual transmission produced in 2012 And with the 2011 Cayenne second generation redesign Porsche also stopped trying to compete with Range Rovers and Gelandewagens offroad in fact RR had turned to copying Porsches performance SUV idea the lowrange transfer case was dropped Gone too was the 6speedV8 combo And whereas in 2008 Wendelin Wiedeking had engineered the biggest shortsqueeze in history that briefly saw VW become the most valuable company on the planet in 2009 his gambit turned against him finally ending in 2012 with the acquisition of Porsche by VW Nevertheless Wiedekings housingboomera independent Porsche had left us with the first performance SUV that also had a combo of characteristics never seen since Naturally aspirated highrevving V8 that comes alive above 4k RPM and makes a noise that sounds like Nascar 6speed manual Optional active antiroll Lowrange transfer case so you can drive ridiculously slow Optional air suspension with huge ground clearance True 4WD with a locking center differential wability to retrofit a locking rear diff Fuel economy of a Ferrari F430 Scuderia at 13 the price Rarer than a Bugatti in the US 134 CGTS 6SP Porsches 200 Bugattis We shall not see its like again Anyway here are some pics of my Cayenne GTS 6SPD fording a raging torrent and also looking good parked In the case of the Cayenne it might be said that a turbo makes more sense than a NA V8 the GTS is not a stoplight dragstrip specialist since it needs to build revs and has a ridiculously short 1st gear In this sense it is rather like the Ferrari F50 rarest of Ferrari halo cars which was famously a revhappy naturally aspirated F1 engine dropped into a much heavier road car the F50s relatively modest torque number and 8000rpm horsepower peak endows different driving characteristics than its turbo F40 predecessor,Quick post on the Gen 1 Porsche Cayenne GTS 6speed,558

7290,cars,Alright so about 8 days ago my car2004 sonata gls 27 L V6 started having issues on startup like it would take a few more cranks than usual to turn over and was sounding sluggish while starting Im not very automotive inclined so I asked my buddy that was and he said it could be alot of things like a battery or my starter but since I had issues in the past with my fuel line he recommended running seafoam through it because he thought my lines might be dirty and the engine was getting enough fuel on startup Yesterday when I was getting in my car to leave work it wouldnt turn over at all no crank no start I called my buddy to ask if he could come help out and after leaving it for an hour as soon as he showed up it was fine and ran well We cleaned off the battery terminals and it ran fine no startup issues at all until today Today I went to an auto shop to try and get new battery terminal connectors because I thought them corroding might be the issue and when I went to leaveabout 20 mins after driving it there no issues it wouldnt start the guys at the shop took a look at it and they tested the battery alternator and starter and they found no issues then I took it to Oriellys after getting a jump and they couldnt find any issues with any of them either at least with their diagnostic machines Then it wouldnt start up again here at home and someone offered to jump it which didnt do anything I think its either the starter going completely bad or maybe its the wiring from the battery to something either way idk exactly what it is any help would be appreciated Thanks Edit just to add im also getting power to the car all dash lights and headlights work,I have a weird issue with my 2004 hyundai sonata V6 no crank no start,327

7593,cars,Most everything barring the housing market is getting cheaper TVs computers etc due to improvements in manufacturing practices and “just in time” warehousing and various other LEAN principles so why and what is Nissans rationale for bumping the price of their Nissan from 70000 to 113000 other than to “have a semblance of premiumness” I understand the cost of vehicles have been steadily increasing in spite of all of the innovations and lean practices I mentioned but a BMW 3 series 6 cylinder 335i 340i cost roughly 40000 back in 2008 and costs about 50000 now which is roughly the same exact pricing scheme for over 10 years It might be comparing apples to oranges but the same thing holds for Audi R8 pricing From Kelly blue book 	The 2008 BMW 328i Sedans Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price MSRP starts around 33000 the 328xi Sedan is around 35000 and Sports Wagon trims are about 2000 more The 335i Sedan bumps the starting price to nearly 40000 and a fully loaded 335xi can run as high as 55000 	The 2008 Audi R8 starts at a Manufacturers Suggested Retail price of roughly 116000 with the manual transmission or 125000 if you check the R tronic box 	The 2021 R8 is worth consideration if youre shopping for a highperformance sports car that is as long as it fits your budget Prices start at around 143000 and can soar past the 200000 mark so Im still have trouble understanding the math behind the GTRs pricing Itd be more understandable if it went from 70000 to 90000 but 113000 Nah For good measure From an online article 	The 2009 Nissan GTR equipped with a 480horsepower twinturbo 38liter V6 engine and advanced 6speed dual clutch automatic transmission has a Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price MSRP of 69850 for the GTR and 71900 for the GTR Premium model exclusive if Destination Handling,How was the Nissan GTR released at 70000 but double in price now 113000 Cant be inflation and cant be cost of parts or labor so what gives,313

7597,cars,Long story short a coworker bought a vehicle that had an engine upgrade dropped in The seller explicitly stated the vehicles horsepower purely based off of the engines spec Coworker took the car to a dyno shop and it could only get about half of the advertised rated horsepower Something was clearly holding back the engine and while he could investigate hes more interested in returning for a full refund The seller is arguing that he did tell the truth but said the horsepower rating was an up to thing and he never promised sustained horsepower My coworker said hes going to let his lawyer handle that advertising definition I was wondering if any car manufacturers have ever tried playing fast and loose with horsepower rating such as the car only hitting the advertised horsepower for a short time before something holds it back eg fuel starvation overheating etc,If a car has an engine that is rated for 150 horsepower but the transmission cooling andor fuel system limits the car to less than 100 horsepower can the car still be advertised as 150 horsepower,149

7706,cars,Ive always been pissed off about these lovely performance cars sitting around in some garage because the owner is more worried about the depreciation from high mileage instead of enjoying their car This isnt just limited to some supercars which arent suitable as a daily drivers thus expected to have low mileage accumulated over the years but also includes cars like the R8 911 CarreraTurbo and 812 Superfast essentially your super grand tourers But how accurate of a measure mileage is for a cars condition anyway If most of what youve been doing in your 911 Turbo is going 140kph max on a highway on auto gear selection as the ob computer keeps the revs in the most optimal range for low fuel consumption or ideal wear and tear any component of your cars powertrain will not be stressed as they would be if you used it mostly to track it on the weekend and neither will the chassis be subjected to the kind of strain resulting from flexing through high speed corners Maybe 5060 years ago when road cars had practically zero telemetry and anything like an OBD was a distant pipe dream this was a reasonable assumption out of necessity because there were very little alternative means of inspection except an expensive teardown of the car disassembly of the engine transmission etc In 2021 Automotive manufacturers have integrated around 60100 sensors per car all connected to a ECM constantly recording and analyzing how the car is operating at any given time Now with all of this information available it should be possible to come up with a weighted metric of depreciation particularly of drivetrain derived from a simulated or real world tests accumulated from these sensor data Any mechanical engineer is able to calculate the kind of strain certain Gforces would inflict on a cars chassis before the first one rolls off the production line They continuously run simulations and tests on engine wear and tear as well as other components and they have all the data in the world to make informed assumptions in software about the cars wear and tear history based on sensor data A car with 30K kms which has 10K track kms might be in worse condition than a 60K kms car which has been driven to and from work and we can only have a more educated assumption about it by including other factors contributing to wear and tear in a final analysis Now your ordinary buyer doesnt need to understand any of this just like your ordinary citizen doesnt have to grasp the intricacies of the Ph Richter or Decibel scales when reading about them on some news website All they need to know is that there is a scale which corresponds to how they would rate a cars condition from 110 and lowerhigher numbers are better so they make more informed decisions about their purchase Id like to hear some opinions on this especially if people from the industry could deliberate on the intricacies or difficulties of coming up with a metric which would accurately assess the condition of a cars drivetrain,Mileage as an accurate measure of wear and tear,522

7865,cars,Why do we consider the Miata to be a better car than some big expensive car that will hit 60 mph in 3 seconds Even though it cant compete in a straight line the Miatas chassis offers a lot of feedback its steering is direct and communicative its light and agile and tossable We couldnt care less if it hits 60 mph in 6 seconds or 3 It doesnt matter The enjoyment of our cars are about all of these things The chassis steering dynamics character of the engine how the shifter feels etc and absolutely not about how quick the wheels rotate when you mash the accelerator Its about driving on winding mountain roads and feeling one with the car its about going to trackdays exploring the cars edge of grip and becoming a better faster driver It makes me cringe when I see FB groups where people try to make little Fiesta STs which are basically the FWD hatch Miatas into a wannabe drag racer car with Tunes and mods that kill reliability Or talk about freeway pulls ugh,Straight line speed is extremely overrated and should be largely irrelevant to car enthusiasts,181

8012,cars,I love my V8 muscle car but when the continued everyday operation of the entire Eastern seaboard depends on a single pipeline it should put into perspective for everyone just how important it is to reduce our dependence on oil And its not just a case of foreign oil bad domestic oil good Doubling down on domestic oil production with Drill baby drill isnt an option when a constriction downstream of oil production is just as bad as or worse than a constriction in oil production itself The entire oil production pipeline no pun intended from production to transport to refining to distribution is one vulnerable bottleneck after another EVs arent perfect but theyre objectively better Never mind the environmental argument Im talking about from a security standpoint Even if the electrical grid is just as centralized as oil infrastructure it doesnt have to be It just is right now because of the dependence on coal oil and natural gas but solar has the potential to make every homeowner and landlord a contributor of electricity Having solar panels on every rooftop might not be able to supply all of our electrical needs but it would still be a sizable chunk and because its decentralized no single attack or constriction could cripple the grid the way this pipeline attack has The added security alone might be worth the money needed to fund it Also while this happened to the US the US obviously isnt alone in its level of dependence I hope this meets the requirement of discuss policy not politics in the rcars rules,Sadly the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack is another nail in the coffin of oil and internal combustion engines,264

8023,cars,I heard about this topic on one of my reddit posts about hybrid cars being the better alternate to reduced fossilfuel transportation The original commenter said that although EVs are the future the is no infrastructure in place to go all in on it so quickly In my opinion I could agree with the original commenter about that but EVs are now commonplace Most automakers already have or are coming out with electric cars more than hybrid cars I am not sure which I prefer but both reduce fossilfuels just fine What is your opinion on hybrid cars and electric cars,Are hybrid cars better than electric cars,101
8030,cars,Im relatively new to working on cars and fixing stuff but Ive the past 12 years everytime I order parts and they need to be shipped in from say Napa car quest or bumper to bumper they say “yup the order should be in and it should arrive by early next week” something along those lines So I wait first time I didnt even call to check assuming hey would call and they said 1 week and I waited 2 weeks for there call and when I called they said “oh yea that order came in well over a week ago and you never came to get it so we had to send it back” which on some level is my fault but I was new to it second and almost all the times after that except for maybe 2 times I call around when my orders supposed to come in and they either go “yea your orders here” or “yea your order arrived 3 days ago” and I dont understand why Ive never worked for a parts store but why dont they call me Sometimes I really need the part ASAP and I dont want to annoy them by calling them everyday Any insight or someone else share this problem,Why do parts stores almost never call me when my parts are in,211
8037,cars,Hello everyone I own a 2016 C300 Coupe Edition 1 and it has been with me for 5 years Youd expect a 5year car to have a milage of on average 100000 km ≈ 62000 miles but my car has only covered 25000 km recently ≈ 15500 miles Its typically new and in excellent condition However since Ive heard rumors about the V8 getting discontinued and that the future models of C63s will be either hybrid or fully electric I considered buying it My friends have suggested that I mod my car since its still typically new I have made a list of mods for my current vehicle which includes Change exterior colour to a matte grey Change rims to black Change callipers to blue or red Install 64 colours lighting for the interior includes the doors centre console vents door speakers and passenger dashboard Change steering to the new design optional Tune the ECU to Stage 1 or Stage 2 Replace stock exhaust with aftermarket ones Install a new cold air intake There are more mods but those are the most important ones A week ago I found a brand new 2020 C63s for sale Its matte grey with red callipers See I can afford a C63s but Im not sure if I should buy one and sell my current car or mod my current C300 What do you guys think Mod my current car to make it customised and “my own” or buy a new C63s Thank you for reading,Do I replace my C300 with a C63s or keep it and mod it,252

8158,cars, I bought a Veloster N 100km from my house and its got 9km on the odometer Its been in the wrap shop since December so Im picking it up doing a full synthetic oil change Hyundai told me warranty requires a change every 6 months regardless of mileage and that I dont need break in oil My issue is the manual says By following a few simple precautions for the first 1000 km 600 miles you may add to the performance econo my and life of your vehicle • Do not race the engine • While driving keep your engine speed rpm or revolutions per minute between 2000 rpm and 4000 rpm • Do not maintain a single speed for long periods of time either fast or slowVarying engine speed is need ed to properly breakin the engine • Avoid hard stops except in emer gencies to allow the brakes to seat properly • Do not use Launch Control during the breakin process Im concerned about the maintaining a single speed for long periods of time The Hyundai service managers at two locations told me it would be fine and The only thing I need to worry about is not driving it hard revving it high or using launch control But I dont know how much I trust the dealership for accurate info So how should i handle this Is 100km a drop in the bucket and I can just drive in 6th without cruise control My Subaru tuner told me to do a lot of engine braking and then getting back up to speed in 6th and 5th but Subarus are a bit different than Hyundais since the EJ is a lot older of a engine design Thoughts,Bought a new car and need to travel 100km on Highway to get it home Break in says no,289

8163,cars,I dont get this I just dont understand how so many car enthusiasts like myself say that they love driving manual cars and yet no auto makers are manufacturing them Im absolutely certain that if Toyota put the manual back in the Supra if General Motors offered a manual C8 or if Ferrari put a manual in one of their newer models that it would sell like hot cakes And yet not only do auto manufacturers not make manual cars but from what Ive heard GM has actually cited a lack of customer demand as the reason why they arent putting manual transmissions in the new Corvettes I am highly doubtful of this and I cant reconcile why Porsche and BMW are the only manufacturers putting a serious effort into keeping the manual alive if theres apparently a huge demand for manuals in performance cars Can someone explain,The manaual transmission paradox,148
8167,cars,Googled around trying to figure out how to disable the super annoying seatbelt chime in my 17 4Runner TRD Pro all threads said to use the Carista app Android and Apple and their 29 dongle from Amazon It requires a subscription but comes with one month free plenty of time to change the settings you want then cancel the subscription To prefix I always wear a seatbelt But the chime is SUPER annoying when offroading and climbing in and out of the vehicle frequently 4Runner 1 Enabled remote window rolldown rollup via the key fob WHY is this disabled by default 2 Enabled window rolldown rollup via key in drivers door similar to how back window operates 3 Disabled the super irritating seatbelt chime dash indicator still appears 4 Slightly lowered the light sensitivity of the auto headlight activation so it doesnt come on quite as quickly useful for tunnels or heavily shaded areas 5 A couple other minor tweaks like how long certain lights stay on when lockingunlocking the car and how fast it autolocks if you dont open doors after using the remote to unlock Girlfriends 2018 Audi A5 1 Disabled the super annoying seatbelt chime dash indicator still lights up 2 Disabled the engine autoshutoff thing by default can still activate via the dash switch 3 Disabled autounlock of exterior doors when the car is put into Park she said it made her feel unsafe 4 Decreased the time it takes to remotely pop the trunk from 800ms to 500ms 800ms felt slightly too long with arms full of groceries 5 A couple other minor qualityoflife tweaks to how long interior and exterior lighting stays on Id say all in all it was worth the 29 Worth noting is the Audi had many more options available than the 4Runner including adding developer settings to the infotainment and allowing to swap the RPM and MPH clusters in the dash,Disabled annoying seat belt chime auto engine shutoff auto doorunlock when going into park and enabled remote window rolldown which is disabled by defaultwhy on 4R and Audi A5,321

8206,cars,So the car industry is moving away from huge engines with huge emissions towards hybrids and electric etc and thats fantastic but I really hope there remains a market for highend luxury sports vehicles which continue to be ICE with modern cleverness They just have more heart more soul A lot of people are saying that very few new V12 engines will ever be made again which is sad to me They sound amazing they are smooth as silk and they produce the sort of effortless power which is hard to replicate in other ways The reason is V12s drink fuel which is true but how much of that is because modern V12s are all 5L monsters I would dearly love to see someone produce a sports or GT car powered by say a 30L V12 engine boosted using an electric supercharger and torque infill motor Youd get the response of a NA ICE with electrical assistance Youd get the smooth power curve thanks to that motor filling in the transmission blips Best of all using a boost motor and an electric supercharger does nothing to diminish or dampen that glorious noise and V12 engines love to rev high Reliability etc I just dont think that is of much concern here Such an engine would only be in supercar anyway and they are already expensive and brittle What do we think,Potential for small displacement electrically supercharged V12s,231

8231,cars,Or more specifically how do you handle jumping between two similar purposed vehicles that wind up being vastly different I have a 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis It was my daily for six years 20142020 I love that car the boatyness the vast improvement in quality over my prior beater 95 MGM Its been through a fair amount of repair work and maintenance and its still in need of more But I loved it drove it without qualms enjoyed the heck out of it And then I bought my CX5 with all the decadeandahalf improvements time brought along All the bells and whistles you could basically get on one in 2017 I love my new daily driver it does everything the MGM did and 10x more But I still own both vehicles No one but me drives either one of them And I dont know what to do about it All of the quirks and things I brushed off with the MGM are now annoyances now that I see what a proper nice vehicle is supposed to feel and drive like I feel like downgrading when I switch back to the MGM for weekend errands in town because it needs to move I cant just let it sit I made plans to switch out the vehicles for commuting and errands I drive 500mi a week in commuting got duplicates of everything needed so I could swap back and forth without issue and then I just Cant I have a favorite now and dont want to go back to the BEFORETIMES I want a second vehicle for personal and familial redundancy reasons and I think Id much rather have a trucktruck to plow haul etc instead of a large boaty sedan But Im concerned that unless I get something premium Im never going to want to drive it except when I absolutely have to Or is my concern mainly because both my vehicles fill the same plushypremiumy dailydriver niche that Im comparing them apples to apples and grabbing something fundamentally different will be fine because itll be more applesoranges tldr New car is nice and makes old car look bad what do QQ FirstWorldProblemsjpg,How do multicar vehicle owners handle the differences between them,362

8273,cars,I had this idea back in 2019 when I was leaving the show on the last day I dont know any easier way to reach a bunch of automotive youtubers than redditcars Get a bunch of youtube creators podcasters together and split a booth at SEMA Bring in power a TV a few tables and a few places to sit Each one that contributes gets to play their videos during the week and have a place to meet fans talk about their channel and promote inside the show Booths run about 33500 for a 10x10 kitted out including the SEMA membership As we all know seating space is at a premium during the show Its not a lot of space to share I know But I envision a point fairly quickly if this caught on that we could have a large booth with a few seating areas and give back to the people with a place to sit during the show Plus there would be a place under a table that you could store snacks tripods etc that you dont want to carry all day And a podcast channel could come and live stream from the booth I know theres a place near magnaflow that does this but I think they only book large podcasters Obviously theres some cost and some major logistics to work out and its really key that theres some financial commitment from people serious about the idea And thered have to be a generic name not any one channel for the booth to create some interest But Id be in for a 300350 expenditure to have a spot to meet people hand out some swag rest my feet during the day and promote my brand along with other people trying to do the same If someone wants to run with this by all means take the reignsjust let me be a part of it somehow,Are there any automotive youtuberspodcasters going to SEMA 2021 that see value in this idea,319

8469,cars,I am currently driving a W205 C200 and living in a small city state ie no country roads or any other fun roads to go for a drive The car is an ok drive I mean steering is a bit numb and light but the power is more than adequate for city driving and for our low speed limits max of 90kmh on highways People here drive very slow in general as well I am thinking of switching to a real sports car like a Cayman S or a 911 Carrera But even for these cars with less than 400bhp is there really any point if all I am doing is driving in the city I drive like a maniac occasionally but even so I rarely go more than 120kmh on highways and 90kmh on regular roads and I imagine Id hit these levels much faster in a sports car how fun can that be,Is there any point owning a sports car if you drive in a city 100 of the time,155

8562,cars,Not exactly sure if this is the right place to post but today on a whim I sold my 2018 GT premium a10 back to the dealer that sold me it I decided that the premium isnt a must have and in the a10 I can never even get to 6 or 7th gear let alone 10th in paddles so I went with a 2021 mustang GT base manual 6 speed Ive had two mustangs prior and I attempted to take a test ride dealer gave me and wife the keys and said “ go take her out “ I told him Im basically barebones with manuals Never really drove one owned a couple low cc motorcycles but thats really it So as I attempted the ride I didnt have any appropriate footwear as I came right from a formal job orientation and forgot my other shoes So dress shoes and the massive clutch force required in that monster were definitely a nogo for me The dealer took me for a ride and I bought the car right after I absolutely loved it They gave me my a10 as a loaner until I pick up the car next week to take it home Im going to pick it up later in the evening after traffic dies down in the city It will be about a 40 mile drive back home in the manual Any tips from any mustang owners Any tips at all Apparently first gear is really stiff and the dealer recommended since I havent driven manual formally I should start the car in 2nd gear Is that accurate I plan on working with just the clutch and bite point before I even worry about gas in the parking lot after the dealer closes Ill get it moving around the dealership then head home once I feel comfortable Decent idea I understand all the components but shit is that clutch heavy,New 2021 Mustang GT,322

8574,cars,Just wanted to share my current experience with VW that has completely soured my short golf r ownership and I will likely sell it and never touch a VAG car again I bought a 1 year old golf r with 10 000 km about 6 weeks ago 2 weeks in and the gearbox blew I took it in to VW to have them check it out and they told me it needed an entirely new gearbox which I thought thats fine it happens its still well within warranty so all good They then called me 2 days later telling me it wasnt covered under warranty because the launch control was used too many times and this counts as misuse So they sent me an invoice for 13000 they werent going to give me a loan car oh and also a 200 diagnostics fee I had to pay even if I didnt get it fixed as an extra slap in the face on my way out So I asked where in the warranty terms was there any mention of a limit to the amount of launch controls could be used and how could a standard feature of the car come under misuse No response I emailed and called their customer service team the dealer and made an inquiry to their online support Nothing The only way Ive had any sort of response is by threatening to go to consumer affairs I live in Australia they are currently investigating it now Ive been 4 weeks without a car and VW couldnt care less The most disappointing thing is Ive had 3 Volkswagens and worked my way up to the r which has always been my dream car and now all I want to do is sell it and never touch a VAG car again So if this kind of stuff is important to people my advice is to stay away from that company because they have zero care about their customers PS what little info I did receive was straight from VW Aus head office TLDR VW refused to honour their warranty or give any kind of explanation and left me stranded without a car for 4 weeks and counting,Awful experience with Volkswagen,368

8658,cars,Obviously Toyotas strategy of attempting to sell the entire GZG50 Century outside of Japan didnt work out because they only managed to sell 27 of them to private individuals all within the geographical confines of Asia most of whom were in the Middle East They went to the effort of creating European SKUs for the model and getting it certified there only to sell some to Japanese diplomats keeping whatever they couldnt sell for themselves Since the 1GZ is still the only Japanese V12 to ever enter series production this shower thought had recently popped into my head would Toyota have found more success in selling it abroad had they put it in a Lexus instead Obviously I can see that rebadging the Century as a Lexus wouldnt have worked since it was just a traditionalist ultraluxury sedan with limited appeal Since the GZG50 Centurys launch coincided with the refresh of the XF20XF21 LS I thought to myself that adding the 1GZ as a new powertrain option may have made sense V12 luxury sedans were in their prime after all so Im surprised that Toyota only made a poor attempt to compete in that subsegment Lexus after all was created to compete the likes of BMW and Mercedes both of whom had V12 versions of the 7 and S respectively so why didnt they think of making a V12 LS I imagine that Toyota could have taken the XF21 air ride LS given it the 1GZ and offered some new exclusive equipment for that model It could have carried the LS500 nameplate and the SKU of GCF21 or even GCF22 if they felt that the higher level of equipment would warrant the creation of the XF22 designation to put it above the air ride 21,Would Toyota have succeeded in exporting the 1GZ V12 if they stuck it in an upgraded Lexus LS,295

8663,cars, This video is a testament to just how much the Corolla has improved in its latest 12th generation The new TNGAC platform is fantastic and when you pair that with a more powerful engine and a CVT with a physical gear what you end up with is pure magic Not to mention the fact that these new Corollas in both sedan and hatchback forms look attractive and sporty I also love that a 6 speed manual transmission with automatic revmatching is an option on both the Corolla sedan and hatchback I know that the Corolla is the favorite punching bag of car enthusiasts who love to dismiss it as a boring cheap ugly econobox To be fair to these enthusiasts Corollas in the past couple of generations were indeed boring econoboxes Not anymore 12th gen Corollas especially in higher trims are truly a massive improvement over older Corollas Dont take my word for it though Click the link above and watch the video above Let the experts who review cars for a living tell you why they chose the 2021 Corolla as their champion,2021 Corolla Defeats 2021 VW Jetta 2021 BMW 228Everyday Driver,184

8686,cars,For the most improved Im going to say Hyundai Kia and Skoda They used to suffer reputations for being cheap and crummy But their quality reliability and general impressiveness has made them some of the best quality cars on the market in my humble opinion and thats coming from a Lexus IS250 driver Also have to give Dodge and honourable mention since their cars are no longer just redneck scrap Theyre very clever and of quite respectable quality as far as my research says For most declined my nominees are Nissan CVT issues JD Power consistently ranking their reliability below average and general lack of impressive cars and Land Rover killing off the 110 Defender becoming too chintzy as Jeremy Clarkson mentioned on Top Gear and they seem to be revelling in their status as Beverly Hills trophy wives cars rather than shaking that image off What do you folks think,Which car brands have improved or declined the most in the past 1020 years,151
8693,cars,Last week I purchased a Mazda that was listed as a certified pre owned vehicle and even signed a paper stating so when I signed my contract Obviously it played a big role in my decision to get the car in the first place Later I get a call from the salesman that they actually made a mistake and that the car actually didnt qualify as a CPO due to it not meeting the age requirement it missed it by about 6 months However since it was his mistake for selling the car to me under the pretense that it was a CPO he said the dealership would honor it and even throw in an extra year of bumpertobumper All I have to do is drive all the way back 3 hrs and resign a contract that states all of this Obviously all of this sounds way too good to be true Id like to state that I am financing this vehicle and came in with a preapproved loan so I asked him what happens when my banks check arrives to them He said because of the mistake neither my banks check or their own financing would go through until the contract is rewritten Another thing I found odd was that I signed a “AsIs” paper when completing the forms which struck me as odd considering it was a car supposedly under warranty but I blame that on myself for not having experience with car dealerships My fear is that they made a mistake and now theyre trying to make me sign my warranty away Which if it is the case I guess I wouldnt mind since the vehicle has a clean history and very low mileage the issue would be that I paid the premium of it being the CPO Does this sound like something that commonly happens If they take my warranty away can I renegotiate the price,Advice Mazda sold to me as a CPO get a call later that this actually wasnt the case due to its age but since they made the mistake they want to honor it and even give me an extra year of warranty Are they messing with me,320

8702,cars,There was a post recently in the Corvette forum showing a meme Camaro vs Mustang vs Corvette and a lot of the discussion was around how they are all different types of cars and thus cant be really compared fairly A lot of the discussion was focused on the definitions of these categories which is also routinely discussed in comments across a lot of forums all over the place I know this is probably asking for a lot of debate but I wanted to put together a quick guide to Car Category Definitions using credible sources online Ill post those at the bottom I will also keep the definitions short as the long answers are in the posts Lastly some cars can be in multiple categories which is where some people get hung up Muscle Car Go Fast in a straight line Typically rear wheel Front engine 2 door V8 and American made Exampleand last true muscle car Dodge Challenger Sports Car Speed and Handling over anything else Most are 2 door engine mount and size doesnt matter Typically 2 seaters but can be 22seats Examples Corvette Porsche 911 370Z Supra and many more Pony Car a subset of sports car Blurring the lines between muscle and sports car Example Camaro and Mustang Exotic Car a term to describe very rare cars either due to production numbers or less available over time Because of their nature supercars and hypercars are exotic but not all exotic cars are supercars or hyper cars Examples Over time Examples Shelby Cobras early generation Corvettes etc Production Examples LaFerraris Mclarens Ford GTs Dodge Vipers etc SupercarHypercar Gonna copy and paste this one for simplicity When you hear the term supercar you know that the vehicle is special a rarity perhaps an exotic model when you hear the term hypercar you know that the vehicle is one of the top performers on the planet The big supercarhypercar differences are design performance and rarity — a supercar is a worldclass vehicle but a hypercar pushes the boundaries of the possible while generally being produced in more limited quantities Example most ferraris lamborghinis dodge viper ACR Porsche 918 GT3 supercar vs LaFerrari the latest Bugattis and Koenigseggs Mclaren Sabre hypercar Halo Car all about Brand here Most brands have their Halo Car Its a car that goes out of its way to push the technology styling and performance a brand can offer Branding A brands “halo car” is often the car that brand enthusiasts dream about and drool over The top of the auto manufactures vehicle offering Example Chevrolet Corvette Dodge Viper NSX Porsche 918 Nissan GTR ,Defined Muscle Sports Exotic Supercar Hypercar Halo,439

8937,cars,Im at my wits end here Also Im a Doordash driver so I drive this car in the city for as much as 4hrs at a time Initially this started with the car sputtering and misfiring never actually stalling though This ended up being an easy fix as the ignition coils had gone Got those replaced as well as the egr valve Car was good for over a month THEN this shit happens with the cars engine sort of starting to hiccupthe revs blip then drop car shakes a bit at idle the revs cutting out while accelerating it starts to seemingly upshift then downshift and then die whilst coasting at 30mph The car was running fine after having driven it for 2 hrs prior to this first occasion Anyways I took it back in The mech thought that it could be related to the egr valve and he saw that the egr solenoid had burned out so he replaced thatI also opted to replace the timing beltwater pump It needed it bad So he gives it back to me says its running fine and I take it out to work the next day Again it runs fine for like an hour then starts doing the same thing also the CEL came back on I immediately bring it back to him whilst its still doing this he pops the hood and gets out his OD2the car stalls out whilst hes trying to get a read lol and tells me its posting a code for Ignition 1 misfire or something to that effect ie same thing that prompted him to replace the ignition coils the first timeJust as a side note I asked him about the 02 sensors and he said they were fine but he hadnt checked them He couldnt make heads or tails of it he even suggested replacing the ignition coils that he had already replacedthey were under warranty of course So he hangs on to it and decides to clean out the throttle body check the coilsthey were good and tighten down the terminal cables on the batteryI told him they were loose After this apparently he drove it and it was good I asked for how long the tech said not long at allof course and they didnt charge me for the last visit But they were pretty adamant about it being good to drive now Well same day I got it back I go out and try and work and after not driving it even 30 minutes the thing starts acting up again doing the same shit I noticed the engine light had come back on not even 15 minutes after driving and while the car felt pretty solid up till that point I had also noticed the slightest blipsdrops in revs while idle as well as a bit of bog off the line Something still wasnt quite right So yeah that my problemstory If I bring it back in tomorrow it will be the third time Ive brought it back in for the same issue Should I bring it back in to the same place Do these people sound competent to you guys tldr Work that has been done Ignition coils removereplace egr valve and solenoid removereplace timing beltwater pumpalso harmonic balancer was TRASHED removereplace cleaned throttle body Prevailing Issue Cars is stalling unstable revsindicated by tach whilst at stop and drivingcoasting Engine cuts out while accelerating but recovers EDIT Let me know if there is a more appropriate subreddit to post all this lol,1999 Camry 22l I4 130k miles Engine stalling loss of power while accelerating,591

9033,cars,So many high performance cars come out and the focus is on their 14 mile time and whether they are faster by 01 seconds on a run Im talking about the 600 HP cars ZL1 GT500 Demon all the cars with hellcat engines etc These cars are all 1 automatic 2 come with launch control and other technology so that the computer does 95 of the work I know there is some skill in timing the light and feathering the throttle to not slip but at the end of the day drag racing is now just about pressing 1 pedal Example In this vid a stock mustang races a trackhawk and everybody loses their mind when the trackhawk obliterates the mustang Do they not realize if the drivers switched cars the trackhawk would still win Is it just because going to a drag strip on a random afternoon is easier and more accessible than finding open track days and therefore nobody cares about cornering or braking I would think if youre measuring a car on how fun or exciting it is to drive whether it does a 113 or a 121 quarter mile is just as irrelevant as what its top speed is If I drove Challenger Hellcat and a Camaro Zl1 both for a day I would not notice which had a slightly faster 060 but I would definitely notice which was more capable hitting an onramp at 75mph To clarify I am not talking about competition drag racing Basically Im asking why someone spending 75k is going Hellcat over 911 C6Z AMG etc simply because it does a fast 14 mile,Noob question What is the big deal with drag racing,273

9131,cars,For those that dont know Synthetic Fuel also known as eFuel is another alternative for an environmental improvement for vehicles not just cars to have an equal to more efficient planet saving compared to EVs Although if we just EVs then they would become 100 clean in the future In the UK they plan to no longer sell Combustion Cars at dealerships in 2030 soon will eventually just be EV Cars on the streets Now I do love some EV cars But this is for those that dont want to add weight to their vehicles spend £20k on a whole electronic build on their classic cars or cars they enjoy driving today This also benefits planes and ships when it comes to transport And Im highly sure that if this goes well getting the car parts to replace will be cheaper compared to a full EV build This can also help prevent the waste that will happen when a lot of cars get abandoned being left for dead Now some say this is beneficial for motorsport but Im thinking that this is just beneficial for those on a tighter budget while also wanting to stay clean Link the the Petition Its worth a shot to see if they would debate this idea in the UK If youre confused on how it works It uses water electricity and already existing CO2 in the atmosphere If they do solar panels and other energy efficient things for the electric side then eFuel would be 100 CO2 free We can save combustion cars save jobs for mechanics that dont know tech and allow people to fix their cars at home without the fear of shock,UK a petition for eFuel and other Fuel alternative,281

9137,cars,Say on a hill or otherwise does a auto car in park have a stronger mechanism to hold the car in place than a manual trans car in 1st or R I always use my Ebrake but assuming that failed Im curious whats stronger and better to keep the car in place for no other reason than sheer curiosity,Does an automatic trans car in park hold in place better than a manual trans car in 1st or R,59

9146,cars, Ten years ago gas prices were high and automakers were bringing out a slew of subcompact hatchbacks for customers that wanted something small fuel efficient and affordable The Honda Fit Chevrolet Sonic Ford Fiesta Mazda 2 Toyota Yaris Kia Rio5 Hyundai Accent Suzuki SX4 the Scion hatchbacks Nissan Versa Note Fiat 500 etc As someone who loves the subcompact hatchback I currently own a Honda Fit I love the maneuverability in tight areas the 40 MPG the practicality of the seats folding down to carry large items and price Over the years the subcompact hatchbacks have slowly been killed off here in the United States Only the Kia Rio5 remains and I know that the Kia is on borrowed time and likely wont survive to another generation Further as more and more cars become electric the idea of a subcompact electric hatchback sounds like it would be about 10000 more expensive than a comparable gasoline version therefor making it too expensive for the first time car buyer It also doesnt help that the United States and apparently the rest of the world is switching to taller crossovers so these car companies dont see the financial sense in making a subcompact hatchback anymore The future will be electric crossovers with large tablets and screens making up every interior surface of the car as they autonomously drive you all over the place but Im going to miss the automotive landscape from ten years ago where I feel that driving felt a little more fun in part because of the subcompact hatchback,Im going to miss the subcompact hatchback,259
9149,cars,recently I got a 1989 Nissan Maxima and it has those weird automatic seatbelts that adjust when you shut the door and my friend said that the seatbelts dont lock in place when you pull on them really hard But while I was braking while driving he said that the seatbelt did lock in place without pulling on it Does anyone have more insight on this It isnt my daily car its just a project I picked up for fun but Id like to be sure about if these seatbelts will actually hold a passenger in place or not and if thats something I need to address Its hard to find information on the belts specifically and thats why I came here,Questions regarding automatic seatbelts,122

9162,cars,I never understood why they had two sporty luxury sedans that does more or less the same thing and are almost identical I know the former is compact and the latter is midsize but in truth the G was always a bit bigger than the competition and were closer to midsize which was where the M lied Q50 had a larger passenger and luggage volume than the CTS And M wasnt that much bigger than the G I mean look at the sales figures and it tells everything Rental or not the G series always outsold the M series and by a pretty wide margin So why expend and waste the resources on two overlapping sedans What possibility It wasnt like Lexus GSES where one was sporty but tighter and the other less sporty but bigger comfortable and more luxury,Why did NissanInfiniti had GQ50as well as MQ70 in their lineup,140

9182,cars,It seems like some automakers redesigns or overhauls their chassis with every model change most European and maybe Korean while others particularly the Americans and Japanese take a long time and just do little revision here and there along the way It seems Mercedes and BMW are constantly redesigning their chassis and following that trend the Koreans are doing the same except for commercial vehicles On the other hand Subaru before SGP Subaru Global Platform their architecture was based off of a design from the 80s but revised a bit here and there to meet the safety requirements and driving characteristics amazing how a design from more or less the 80s is one of the safest on the road Toyotas TNGA was the last major complete overhaul but I dont remember the last time they had such a big overhaul of their portfolio maybe in the late 80searly 90s Same for Nissan The Skyline platform wasnt all that significantly different and the key concept was more or less the same until the R34 Then the new FM platform was introduced with the V35 like over 20 years ago now and that rear drive platform is still used today and seems to continue to do so in the near future with the 400Z Jags rear wheel drive platform is derived from when Ford owned the company so those are most likely reaching 20 years old as well Numerous GM platforms have been used for long long time B Body was in production and stayed mostly the same with mild updates from the 20s until the late 90s So what is up with some automakers changing platform constantly and others keeping or rather milking the platform eventhough everything else has changed,How often do automakers fully redesign their chassisplatforms,289

9408,cars,Just curious about what factors go into this My friend let me whip his TLX hard at a track and although the transmission sucks and is jerky it definitely has good pick up while using the manual flippers in sport mode However it was coming close to understeering out pretty easily at curves 3045 mph when other FWD cars Ive driven have no issue making a smooth turn at 5060 mph before it even starts to understeer but even then its way less violent compared to the TLX which seems to want the body of the whole car to rotate Other thing was that the braking was pretty much freaky at 100 mph at around 130 mph the brakes and wheels were outright vibrating and shuddering if I even tapped them with somewhat medium force Not sure if this was a separate issue of the brake pads rotors since the car is relatively new less than 20k miles There were even times the brakes practically seem to give out on hard brakes so honestly I am actually going to err on the side that there is something genuinely messed up with the brakes At the end of it this was useful since I am much more sold on not getting the TLX except the ASpec when it depreciates for the future cause it was all over kind of disappointing in terms of how the TLX doesnt let you drive it at the limits without giving some type of worrisome sign Acceleration and straights were pretty dope otherwise The transmission really does suck though It would jerk switching and it did not feel like a smooth ride,What factors determine if a FWD car will have understeer spin out going through curves at high speeds Acura TLX track report,276

9417,cars,My engine has started shaking and bucking violently when the car is put in reverse but gets worse when car has been driven and the engine is warm I have another automatic 850 a 97 and the 1994 takes a bit more force to change from park to reverse Have changed the lower passenger engine mount transmission mount and upper torque mount still have the problem Cant be the ebrake being stuck on or the axlescv joints because it happens even when the brakes are applied and car isnt moving Its a transverse I5 and when I mean it bucks and shakes the back of the engine lifts up as if the engine is twisting on the longitudinal axis of the car over and over again until the transmisison is taken out of reverse Every other gear is buttery smooth as is the idle since I changed out the mounts The transmisison fluid levels seem to be right where theyre supposed to be I did three drain and fills and the fluid went from runny brownnot burnt smelling to the color of a dirty red wine problem went away for a day or two then came back There was no metal on the magnetic plug This problem started a month ago with just occasional vibration when backing up with the car still warm but has gotten worse to the point where almost every time I back out of my driveway it happens and is very violent when the car is warm Giving it gas used to stop the problem but now seems to make it worse,1994 Volvo 850 automatic engine violent shaking in reverse 110k miles,266
9418,cars,This might seem like a bit of a stupid question but why cant you use your left foot for the brake in an automatic I know that if youre switching between automatic and manual cars then you need to ensure to keep your left foot only for the clutch but if you arent then surely it isnt a problem To me it seems that it would be safer to only use your left foot on the brake and your right foot on the accelerator because you wouldnt need to think about switching pedals you would be less likely to use the wrong pedal Im talking about the UK here where most cars are manual,Can I use my left foot on the brake when driving an automatic,114

9539,cars,I will try to explain this as understandable as possible Im even having a hard time putting this to words as to what is going on I listen to music through my phone This all started to happen sometime last year around June I should say The phone that I have been listening to my music on was a Google Pixel 3a so I was able to use the aux cord without an extra part as you do with the newer iPhones When I would listen to music I would have the aux cord in and have my phone charging at the same time Sometime last year when I plugged in the charger while my car was on I then plugged in the aux cord on my phone and I noticed the speakers made like a loud “bass” static kind of noise but didnt think much of it It kept on doing this for quite some time after Also to note that my car has a navigation system pretty old one and whenever it started to get hot this also happened last year it would have a pop up saying see dealership and then basically shut off That doesnt stop me from listening to music though Eventually around June I was driving and out of nowhere my music mind you the volume was at 15 pretty normal sound coming through just basically I guess “lowered itself” in a way that I couldnt hear any of the beats or background sounds from the music and the singing kind of got lower too as if someone lowered my volume Nothing was lowered my phone volume was high and the car was at 15 After some time I didnt know what was going on it would constant do this and go back to normal when I have both my aux cord and charger plugged into my phone Eventually that stopped working to being normal sounds I eventually got the new iPhone and had to buy a new port to plug into my phone I even bought a new aux port and nothing changed it still sounded like nothing was fixed So I went to the dealership and they basically told me it would be 150 of labor per hour to see whats wrong but the employee there told me to upgrade my navigation system to 2020 thinking thats probably the problem which I did but that didnt change cause it still says see dealership I went back and showed him how the sound was coming out they couldnt diagnose by just listening and then they told me to probably change the auxiliary port so I did that by hand but again nothing changed I saw a video of someone changing the fuses cause it could be from the cigarette port so I did that and nothing has changed My car radio works perfectly fine its just that I cant even listen to music on my phone anymore without it doing whatever it does Some days it would go back to normal but if I make a little turn that was slightly ruff then the sound changes back to whatever I described I dont know what to do at this point I really dont want to go back to the dealership spending a lot of money to find out it was a simple fix So Im asking for advice here and if worse comes to worse then i will go to the dealership Im just getting annoyed at this point Its almost been a year and I just want to listen to my own playlist LOL,Honda Civic 2008 Auxiliary problem,602

9598,cars,I want to preface this by saying that this post is particularly subjective and I kindly request that all responses are respectful and educational Ive always loved sports cars and my recent experiences with track driving and watching motorsports in general has created a sense of bias in me towards stripped down and authentic sports cars regardless of price I grew up adoring the 911 for its sporty looks handling and performance Its aesthetics suited its purpose and there was never really any doubt about whether or not it was a pure sports car Fast forward a couple years and Ive noticed that many manufacturers that have historically been known to build sports cars continue build fast cars indeed but I often find myself questing whether one can really call them sports cars The BMW M5 MercedesBenz E63 AMG and the Audi RS7 are some of the more popular sports sedans on the market for obvious reasons Theyre luxurious comfortable and will smoke a base 911 in a straight line with your entire family on board Its a no brainer and its mighty impressive But you see I dont really like that they exist It almost feels like cheating in a way its not supposed to be that easy I guess Im sort of a purist when it comes to cars I believe that blurred lines between categories of cars should be fairly restricted Hatchbacks should be small and economical sedans should be spacious and comfortable SUVs should be functional and practical and finally sports cars should light agile and powerful Now obviously this will never happen in a consumer economy but has no one noticed that the blurred lines between the categories are just as thick if not thicker than the categories themselves Essentially it bothers me that BMW and Mercedes spend most of their budget figuring out ways to make a 4door 2 Ton machine go 060 kph in less than 35 seconds instead of focusing more on their true and in my opinion grossly overlooked sports models Although I will concede that the M2 is probably one of the best things BMW has put out in a very long time To be fair I also cant complain much about the M4 series except that its clearly about the same size of the previous generations 5series which kinda bugs me The purist in me hates to see 2 ton 4door machines labelled as sports cars IMO once youve begun to compromise youve stopped really being a sportsfocused car For reference some of the sports cars I appreciate include Porsche 911s Caymans Boxsters Nissan 370Zs Honda Civic Type R hell even the Ford Focus ST with its manual transmission Recaro seats and a lightweight body is more a true sports car than an M5 in my books rather the M5 and E63 are freakin spaceships I guess I rate overall feel higher than actual performance Driving a sports car isnt supposed to be comfortable but rather exhilarating and engaging I excluded luxury GT cars like the Ferrari California Maserati Granturismo Merc SLseries and the Sclass coupe from this rant since I dont feel like theyre trying to be sporty cars and nor do they put up the kind of numbers these other spaceships do Also Ive obviously omitted super cars as well since well because can you really call them sports cars But above all what bothers and confuses me so much is simply the fact that I seem to be the only one who feels this way BMW achieved such great success with the 4door 6series Gran Coupe that they discontinued the 6series coupe including the M6 coupe entirely I found this almost blasphemous since the 6series was always intended to be the sporty class within BMWs lineup but pretty much all my friends disagreed with me Moreover the AMG GT 4door which I think is basically a TRex appears to be doing better than the original AMG GT Coupe The M3 is also doing just as well as the M4 in my region What is going on here Why have consumers stopped caring about the raw feel of sports cars I get that people want the best of both worlds but has that really become so common to the point of cancelling famous sport models all together Id love for someone to spread some insight as to what I may be missing and perhaps shed some light on the consumer economics of sports cars Cheers,The Growing Popularity of HighPerformance Sports Sedans and Why I hate It,748

9897,travel,Hi all Were doing a trip to Malta for a week in late August with a friend We dont really know where is the best place to stay on the island While were not opposed to moving accommodation the island is small and many say you dont need to move around for places to stay so it would be more comfortable to stay the whole week in one place if its not too much hassle is that true Is Sliema the best place I saw there are beaches are they nice and buses connections are good no As for transport we would like to do all in buses if possible We can rent a car if needed but we would prefer not driving on the left is kind of worrying for us Are buses good frequent not too crowded go everywhere enough I have seen conflicting opinions on this The type of trip would be visit of ruinsmedieval citycastles and beachswimming to relax mostly after the visits of the day more than like a full day at the beach so being able to go on foot would be better than having to take bus and such We want to do the classic highlights of Malta may be important for buses reasons Valetta the Three Cities Mdina Comino Gozo,Oneweek trip to Malta advices,218

9925,travel,While vaccines are starting to be administered in several countries the coronavirus COVID19 situation continues to have a major effect on travel with many now looking to understand if when or how their travels might be feasible Accordingly rtravel is continue its megathreads on a monthly basis until the crisis dissipates In the interest of reducing the number of oneoff questions before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following Are borders open What entry or transit restrictions are in place Will I need to quarantine A list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources including from IATA Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures You may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country Because information can change on short notice it is important to verify the latest information ideally from government sources in the US At the time of writing foreign nationals are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in or transited via Brazil China India Iran Ireland the Schengen Area South Africa or the UK in the preceding 14 days Exceptions to this rule include green card holders some family members of US citizens and permanent residents and holders of certain visas eg F1 visas under certain circumstances and K1 visas Note that except for of course US citizens this is not a citizenshipbased restriction it is purely based on travel history Because of this those traveling from one of the restricted countries are permitted to enter the US provided they spend the prior two weeks in a nonrestricted country More information about the entry restrictions and the associated proclamations is available on the US CDC website All air passengers – regardless of origin nationality and vaccination status – need to produce a negative result from a viral test taken within 3 days of the first flight on a single ticket to the US Alternatively you may travel with a positive test result from the previous 3 months and a letter from a doctor indicating that youre clear for travel The land borders with Mexico and Canada are closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes but air rail and sea but not commuter rail or ferry portsofentry remain open to nonessential travel No nationwide quarantine requirements exist Some individual states andor cities may have their own guidelines even for domestic travel so you will need to confirm with information from your destination state or city However at this point these quarantine guidelines are primarily recommendations instead of requirements with those for Hawaii being the major exception Note also that COVID tests are not being demanded at checkin security boarding or arrival for domestic travel within the contiguous United States and checkpoints are not being set up at state borders For more information see the US CDCs COVID19 page in Canada At the time of writing foreign nationals are barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for certain mostly essential reasons regardless of mode of travel Those traveling from countries other than the US must also fulfill one of several additional categories of exemptions Those who are permitted to travel to Canada for nonessential purposes include – aside from Canadians – permanent residents and certain family members of Canadians and permanent residents Those wishing to travel to Canada on compassionate reasons may do so provided they receive authorization from the Public Health Agency of Canada Fully airside international transits are typically permitted Starting Aug 9 fully vaccinated Americans and US permanent residents traveling from the US will be permitted to enter Canada for nonessential reasons Border restrictions are expected to be loosened for fully vaccinated travelers for other countries starting Sep 7 All passengers five years or older arriving into Canada by air will also need to produce a negative result from a PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to boarding the last direct flight to Canada Alternatively you may submit a positive COVID19 molecular test taken between 14 and 90 days prior to departure Passengers are required to take an additional test on arrival and unless fully vaccinated quarantine at hotels for at least three days pending negative test results in one of four cities – Vancouver Calgary Toronto and Montreal – that will serve as the only portsofentry by air After being permitted to exit hotel quarantine travelers must continue to selfquarantine until 14 days after arrival during with they must take another test The whole process is expected to cost approximately C2000 per passenger which travelers will have to pay As of Jul 5 those already eligible to enter Canada may qualify for an exemption to quarantine and an exemption from the Day 8 test if they have been fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arrival Starting Aug 9 the requirement to quarantine in a hotel will be removed for all travelers although quarantining will still be required for unvaccinated travelers For more information see the Canadian governments COVID19 travel restrictions page in Mexico At the time of writing there are no changes to Mexicos standard entry requirements However the land border with the United States is officially closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes Travelers must fill out a Questionnaire of Identification of Risk Factors in Travelers to present upon arrival There are no quarantine or testing requirements upon arrival in Mexico For more information see information provided by Mexican embassies including the Mexican Embassy in the Netherlands in the UK At the time of writing foreign nationals are barred from entering the UK if they have entered or transited one of the counties on the red listredlist within the previous 10 days This list is subject to change Irish citizens and those with UK resident permits are in addition to UK nationals exempted from this restriction All passengers entering or transiting through the UK from outside the Common Travel Area which comprises the UK Ireland the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands need to produce a negative PCR LAMP or antigen test taken within 3 days of their last direct flight or other mode of transit to the UK Those who have only beentransited

beentransited in amber list countriesamberlist with the exception of France who have been fully vaccinated under the UK programme or for arrivals from Aug 2 in the EU US or Switzerland are also not required to quarantineamberlistrulesifyouarefullyukvaccinated although they must still take a COVID19 test the second day after arrival The restriction is based on travel history not nationality All other international arrivals including UK citizens will need to quarantine for 10 days after arrival and take a COVID19 test on the second and eighth days after arrival Passengers who have not beentransited in any of the red list countries over the previous ten days may shorten their quarantines in England if they test negative at least 5 days into their quarantine period In England passengers are also permitted to leave quarantine to depart the countryquarantinefor10daysafteryouarrive Unless falling under the green list exemption all travelers regardless of nationality coming from outside the Common Travel Area will in addition to getting tested before departure need to take a test on the second and eighth days after arrival These tests need to be prebooked before

Scotland all travelers who have been outside the Common Travel Area in the previous ten days must book a hotel room for their quarantines These hotel rooms must be booked in advance along with the mandatory tests on the second and eighth days of quarantine With lockdown measures in place within the UK there may be restrictions on travel purposes to from or within the constituent countries For example travel to and from Scotland is prohibited except for limited purposes For more information see UK Border Control and the UK governments information about travel measures in the EU In the Schengen Area In late June 2020 the European Commission recommended that external borders be reopened to shortterm visitors arriving from several countries deemed to have adequately maintained the virus This list of countries however is nonbinding among member countries and is subject to change Nevertheless several countries within the EU or the Schengen Area have used this list as guidance permitting arrivals from these countries as well as EU countries which includes EU and Schengen countries and sometimes the UK These restrictions typically are not based on nationality but rather travel history andor residency consult resources from your destination country However multiple EU countries have temporarily placed additional restrictions on travel from specific countries eg the UK or have reinstated broad restrictions for those from outside the EU the Schengen Area or their own countries due to discoveries of new COVID variants Fully airside nonSchengen to nonSchengen transits are typically permitted but confirm and consult resources from your transit country to see if further documentation which may at times include negative test results is required For example Germanys transit requirements are discussed heref14745744 and herecontent5 In May 2021 the European Commission recommended EU states loosen travel restrictions including by allowing vaccinated travelers to travel to Europe this summer However details about these plans are still being unveiled and each EU country has the ultimate say on its border policies Among the European countries that have reopened to vaccinated travelers are Francesommaire1 although with limitations from red countries Greece Iceland and Spain This list is not exhaustive and some countries are also loosening some restrictions for unvaccinated tourists As the various EU and Schengen countries have opened their external borders to thirdcountry nationals in various ways and with different exceptions it is imperative that travelers check the entry requirements for their portsofentry A summary of travel restrictions is provided by the European Union but many have reported that government eg embassy or foreign ministry resources have been more detailed and accurate in South Korea At the time of writing most nationalities with visafree or visawaiver arrangements with Korea have had their visafreewaiver status suspended primarily on the basis of the reciprocal entry restrictions for Korean citizens There are also additional entry and transit restrictions of those traveling from China All passengers must have a negative LAMP PCR SDA or TMA test taken within 72 hours of departure of the first flight en route to Korea International arrivals with few exceptions including vaccinated Koreans and those vaccinated in Korea will be required to quarantine for 14 days nonresidents will be required to quarantine in government facilities at their own expense For more information see the Korea Immigration Service in Japan At the time of writing foreign nationals who have been in one of 150 countries for purposes other than transit are not permitted to enter Japan Further visas and visa exemptions for nationals from many countries have been suspended Permanent residents longterm residents and spouses and children of Japanese citizens may be exempt from these entry restrictions provided they meet certain conditions Those individuals including Japanese citizens that are permitted to enter Japan will be required to undergo a 14day quarantine All travelers will be required to provide proof of a negative result from a test taken within 72 hours of departure for Japan Additional restrictions are in place for those travelling from the UK or South Africa For more information see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan in Thailand At the time of writing Thailand is accepting travelers that have the proper visa or are visaexempt Visaonarrival facilities as well as visaexempt status for nationals of Cambodia and Myanmar are suspended Travelers entering or transiting Thailand must have a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of the first embarkation point All travelers entering the country are subject to a 14day quarantine Foreigners must have a confirmed hotel reservation for their quarantine and well as health insurance with coverage of at least US100000 When will borders reopen or travel restrictions be lifted Is it safea good idea to book travel for a particular time months ahead It is of course impossible to say when travel restrictions are lifted for every country Where no news has been officially provided it is often very difficult to predict as countries will make decisions based on the progress of the pandemic – which is an unknown – as well as other pressures eg economic or social Consider that the progress of the pandemic and efforts to combat it are unpredictable Countries are approaching the vaccine rollouts in different ways Some countries are exempting vaccinated travelers from testing or quarantine requirements and some are even allowing vaccinated travelers to enter when they would not admit unvaccinated travelers However one should not assume special treatment on account of your vaccinated status as most countries still have not differentiated between vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers In the meantime with the resurgences of cases and new variants recently discovered in several countries some countries have firmed up travel restrictions requiring additional tests or quarantine periods or preventing travel from certain locations Further even if you are ultimately able to travel to your destination there may be lockdowns or widespread closures of businesses and places of interest Realize that you are taking a risk by deciding to speculatively book travel in the hopes that travel restrictions will be lifted by the time you travel or even will remain as liberal as they are in your destination today With this unprecedented situation old adages about when its best to purchase airfare may no longer be valid In any event be aware of the policies of your airlines and accommodations for credits andor refunds should you need to reschedule or cancel Further understand that airlines may make it very difficult to receive a refund even if legally required Many travelers have reported waiting months to receive refunds on cancelled flights or otherwise being stonewalled when requesting a refund And be aware that if your airline goes out of business your funds could be lost forever Take note of your jurisdictions laws regarding refunds for cancelled flights For example US Dept of Transportation Refunds EU Air passenger rights So should I cancel a trip that Ive already booked And how Will insurance help These questions were covered at length in the second megathread Although countries may be starting to reopen the points therein are still relevant Previous related megathreads First

10045,travel,Hi I recently decided that I would like to take a trip to Antarctica sometime in the next few years hopefully and started doing some research on how to get there As I understand you can go there via New Zealand or Argentina I was wondering if anyone here could help me figure out which one to go for Ive never really been out on a ship for several days So I was thinking the taking the trip from New Zealand might be harder And I would also certainly like to get on the continent at least a few times instead staying on a ship throughout I also plan to maybe go kayaking or take part in some other adventures that would be possible I was told it might not be possible to make landings on the cruise from New Zealand because of the weather although I dont know how true this is The main reason the New Zealand option seems great to me is because of the fact it seems to go to a more remote location of the continent and the fact that there would be lesser number of people coming along On the other hand the trip via Argentina also seems less expensive If youve been on either of them what was your experience like What are the major differences and which one would you recommend,Traveling to Antarctica,229

10151,travel,This would probably have been a good fit for rnostupidquestions but I figured that this community was probably more engaged with the mysterious ways of the airline industry Commonly when checking in luggage the checkin counter staff help passengers with marginally overweight luggage to redistribute it into their carryon items For instance I was 2KG over on a US domestic flight and the guy handed me a bag to take some stuff out of my checked suitcase with My question is simply whats the point of all this I understand that airlines have to set some kind of limit for the luggage that they can carry fuel calculations etc but if policies mean that passengers are just redistributing it from the stow hold to the cabin whats the point Presume there is some sort of reason so would love to hear from anybody that has worked this out,Why do airlines care if your luggage is in checked baggage or hold,148

10190,travel,This December we 3 adults 2 teens are travelling to the Allgäu region of Germany We are planning on booking outbound flights from London to Munich however for the return trip we are hoping to take the train back home We understand that there are no direct Eurostar trains between Germany and London but as the timespan of this journey is not much of an issue for us we would be aiming to travel the most scenic route possible Upon initial searches it is suggested that the best route would be StuttgartParisLondon however further research indicates that most of this route is along their new high speed line the flat route mixed with sound barriers and a train racing at 320kmh equals a pretty useless waste of 8 hours As return flights will only cost £400 for the 5 of us taking a train on a route such as that ultimately just seems to be a waste of money The main route which I was looking at was MunichMilanParisLondon this journey takes much longer but the first leg is a sleeper service anyway and the second leg is regarded as being incredibly scenic Although this route costs more and takes far more time if the scenery was worthwhile then Id happily take that option However if anyone disagrees or has better suggestions then that would be incredibly useful as I have received this information from incredibly brief searches Our accommodation is equidistant from both Munich and Stuttgart just outside of Leutkirch im Allgäu so any routes departing fromnear there would be preferable We also have a rental car collected from Munich Airport so if we needed to drive instead of take a train to the main departure point then thats also fine Staying in a hotelholiday rental overnight between trains would also be fine assuming that this layover would be in a fairly wellconnected location If anybody has any suggestions even just if you could direct me to another community to ask this question in then Id be greatly appreciative,StuttgartMunich to London by Train,340

10993,travel,TLDR Which country would you choose to live in in Europe if your primary motivation was a healthy and happy lifestyle with access to nature especially the sea and forests friendly locals fresh food and ideally hot weather What makes it better than other areas in terms of lifestyle in your opinion and why would you personally choose that country The bigger picture I am asking this as a language enthusiast deciding what language to focus on for longterm fluency Im not looking for business or a job just culture I have an unending passion for nature and healthy traditional living especially foodwise with plenty of daily activity and ideally hot weather lol The past year or so has seen me studying Spanish Italian Vietnamese Brazilian Portuguese and even touching up on German • Spanish is soooo varied • Italian is niche and very regionally different but fascinating • Central Germanic incl Swiss and Austrian cuisine seems much less healthy and theres no coast • Portuguese is also interesting but perhaps not as rich and its sound doesnt excite me much • And Vietnamese was more just to understand the culture a little more • Ive also considered a Scandinavian language because I love the sounds and culture but I dont think Id live there due to the climate and they are wizards at learning English well anyway so maybe that should be a future goal I intend to travel all of Europe and around the world if possible but one place to settle would be nice as a goal and motivator The truth is I want an ambition A country where I know Ill always learn more and be able to set my sights on visiting a lot or living in with a balance in life and good wellbeing Yep its a lot The obvious choices in Europe might be Spain Italy Portugal most of Scandinavia Croatia and maybe areas of Greece right Learning resources for the languages make some easier choices whereas Id have a hard to finding Croatians to speak with or comprehensive resources for Croatian for example Anyway throw me your ideas thoughts recommendations debates passions Where and why 😁 Thanks all PS About the languages My problem is that I tend to dabble Fascination catches me off guard when it comes to countries around the world but I havent any strong motive or ambition in particular so its easy for me to learn for fun and then focus on another language thus never reaching high levels of fluency Its both a blessing and a curse This is my attempt to solve it,Best European country to visit or live in Im looking for healthy food lots of nature history and culture and warm people ,437

11062,travel,My wife and I have a “US to Europe and back” flight itinerary that spans three different carriers The long haul flight is under the same reservation number under Iberia Airlines and it is basically a round trip flight from San Francisco to Barcelona The other two pointtopoint flights are RyanAir and WizzAir each under a different reservation number We booked the whole package with Kiwi but are now wanting to use other means to get to Barcelona at the end of the trip Due to how restrictive Kiwi can be with their “saver” tickets we are willing to just miss the Wizzair flight without a refund and get to Barcelona via a different flight from Dubrovnik outside of the Kiwi site It may be easier and less disruptive than canceling My question is… if we miss or cancel the WizzAir flight would that cause our long haul from Iberia Air to get canceled The carriers are not connected and it is under a different reservation Thanks in advance,Point to point flights and long hauls…,169

11162,travel,Hi I am planning a trip to Norway for the summer of 2022 and I noticed a problem as I was doing the planning Little context I am going to be in Stavanger and Ill do a day trip to visit Lysefjord I do not have access to a car and I do not want to rent one The activity I want to do is to visit Lysefjord I specifically want to do some kayak from Lauvvik to Lysebotn as you can see from picture 1 I would book the kayak locationand the ferry with a company called Norways Best from this link On the website the earliest possible booking is at 930 and I would arrive in Lysebotn at 1150 On my way back I would take a ferry from Lysebotn back to Lauvvik at 1230 to arrive at 1455 Here is the problem I encountered In picture 2 you see that to go to Lauvvik you need to take 2 buses The first bus isnt a problem The second bus though departs at 1201 the earliest The activity is at 930 That causes a huge problem because I have no way of getting there before the activity starts which would be at 930 The way to Stavanger back isnt a problem There is also the possibility to do the activities in the afternoon I can do the kayak from Lauvvik to Lysebotn from 1500 to 1730 That being said that means I would have to take the ferry from 1800 to 2030 from Lysebotn back to Lauvvik The last bus that departs from Lauvvik for my way back to Stavanger is at 1850 That does cause a problem Keep in mind that the hours for the ferry and kayaks are not flexible The only choices available are the ones I have mentioned The only solution I see is for me to take the taxi to get there before 930 and to go back by bus as shown in picture 2 My questions are the following Is there another solution asides from the taxi that anyone might know How much would the taxi cost in Stavanger Norway to go to Lauvvik Processing img f6azhckwr9c71 ,Day Trip to Lysefjord from Stavanger Kayak Ferry,365

11189,travel, I recently came back from a 5 day trip to visit a friend from high school I havent seen for 10 years Leading up to the trip the plan was to hang out during the day while his girlfriend worked and grab dinner with her while I was there sounded fine The week leading up to the trip his girlfriend got a new job that didnt start until the week after my visit which meant she would be hanging out with us as well during the days It made me a little nervous since I have never met her and only spoke to her briefly on the phone I decided to go anyway The GF and I end up hitting it off almost immediately big hugs from my buddy when we see eachother the first two days were not too bad when he was awake Seems his sleep schedule has him sleeping to 2pm every day and he has a weird drinking problem where he will be up from 2a5a drinking and smoking until he falls asleep I wouldnt really care except for the fact that the futon I was sleeping on was right next to the porch door so every 30 mins between 2a5a the porch door would open him walking back and forth to the kitchen waking me up This resulted in some pretty poor sleep throughout the trip The first morning I wake up around 9a no one is up I go out get the car washed oil changed etc Come back around 11a no one is up yet okay Ill go get some mcdonalds I guess I come back at 1 and still no one is up so I chill for a while on their porch Finally they get up at 230p We finally leave the house to do something at 4p so basically the first day is shot The next day the same thing happens I literally drive around for several hours until they wake up I mention this to them the second day and my buddy just laughs it off and doesnt offer to get up earlier His girlfriend offer to take me kayaking the next morning while my friend continues his sleep routine that for whatever reason cannot be adjusted when having visitors His GF and I started creating a bond over a surprising number of commonalities I think she liked me not sure how serious but at least a passing interest I know this because I would catch her staring at me all the time My friend picked up on this and his reaction was to start kissing and grabbing her whenever he could while all three of us hung out it made for a really awkward and unpleasant situation for me ironically I enjoyed hanging out with his GF more than when he joined the mix because of his wierd need to constantly touch or kiss her in front of me I get it youre in love but when I have guests over I dont start making out with my partner if front of them out of courtesy Over the 4 days the GF and I form a pretty strong bond she would get up in the morning to hang out since my friend was always asleep till 2p sometimes longer by the 4th day I was over the trip and just wanted to go back home between the awkwardness of my friend seeming to purposely make me feel like the third wheel constantly being woken up by a porch door from him drinking and shit in the middle of the night and expecting me to wait several hours every day for his ass to get up mid afternoon I really had enough and couldnt fake the smiles and niceties anymore On the 5th day early in the morning I packed my stuff in the car I woke up my buddy and told him I had to get going that my dog was sick I think he was in shock because he just said ok gave me a hug and off I went Unfortunately the his GF was out at a doctors exam so I didnt get to say goodbye to her in person I felt aweful about that since she was the only one making a effort to hang out with me and I felt that we really shared a genuine connection platonic On my way back I get a text telling me that his GF has prepaid a jetski rental on the day I left and that she was really upset I texted her apologizing for the abrupt exit that I appreciated and enjoyed her company and asked for her cashapp so that I could pay her for the jetski rental I havent heard back since AITA for leaving on short notice like that given the circumstances I feel like expecting a guest to occupy themselves for several hours every day when they are visiting is kind of BS,Visiting friends and etiquette did I handle this wrong,830

11536,travel,I thought I knew what I was getting into when I signed up for Frontiers Discount Den which offers discounts for every flight you book for a year I expected to use them for many short 2hr flights and I dont care too much about being on time or comfort so I thought the 60year membership fee is worth it A month ago I paid for that membership while booking a flight and saved like 10 I just tried to book another flight Logged into the account but the website told me to buy the membership again and there is absolutely no record on the website that I have an active membership I doublechecked the email receipt of paid membership fee my credit card statement and the membership number on my logged in account everything was correct I thought its a technical glitch and tried many different ways different browser incognito log on and off nothing works Basically Frontiers shitty website cannot keep a record of active Discount Den members so you are essentially getting only a onetime discount when you buy the membership which is not a good deal at all I then tried to contact Frontier about this issue but they dont list any relevant number on their contact page On the phone I chose the phone booking option in order to talk to a real person but after 30min wait a woman apparently cannot understand what Im saying put me on hold and hung up Do not commit to Frontier at all I wasted time over so little savings if Im getting anything at all Id also appreciate any advice on this blatant scam,Frontier Discount Den a de facto scam,277

11550,travel,So I recently renewed my USA passport and on a recent trip I got a bunch of the unofficial passport stamps from national parks Now Ive had many of these ‘novelty stamps in my last passport and never had any problem However the lady who novelty stamped my passport this last time warned me that its a 2500 fine for EACH novelty stamp no one else has ever mentions this I have 6 now At first I was not sure what she was talking about but then I did a little research on it and it seems these stamps can cause quite an issue in some countries and interfere with travel etc There was a pretty recent article of a woman who got seriously hassled for her Machu Picchu stamp So I basically wanna get a new passport even though I literally just renewed it I was wondering if I should just try and renew it the same way I did when it was about to expire cuz I can just do that way by mail by sending in my current passport Or should I say I lost this passport and just have then invalidate it and do the inperson passport application all over again The way I see it is I basically have to get a new passport Its just not worth it to take the chance on either getting fined or have the hassle of not being able to fly home from some other country due to some immigration officer giving me a hard time because of my stamps invalidating my passport Thanks in advance,Replacing 8 month old valid passport,267

11567,travel,Hello I have a problem involving money school and life experience Im curious to see if anyone has suggestions I am CANADIAN 21 going into my fourth year in Visual Arts graduating with no debt due to my gracious and hardworking mother in April 2022 if all goes well I wanted to take a gap year afterwards but I also realized that I needwant to go to Animation school The school is in my city really close so Id be living at home and biking But as of typing this I have very little savings 1150 in TFSA and 500 RRSP Im also frugal and environmental so Ive gotten down to not spending money on crap Heres where it gets tricky The school is INTENSIVE one program is 95 weekdays for 10 months straight costing 25950 As of right now I want to take two courses back to back costing me 51900 I havent and will check but Im going off the assumption that I will not qualify for student loans due to my mothers income So weve kinda discussed coming up with 10k20k she comes up with the rest and I pay her back later Not only that I have to apply 1216 months in advance so for example if I were to apply and get in right now I would be starting October 2022 You can start at irregular times like in November or March it is very nonlinear unlike regular university To further add to the dread I have to have a portfolio Now while my conceptual art skills are really good in my humble opinion the portfolio will require mainly drawing in relation to technical skills As of now with my skill and work ethic It will most likely take me a year to reach the acceptable level of skill to enter the school So lets pretend I started right now I apply in August of 2023 I luckily get accepted would get in 2024 and in two years somehow save almost 20000 Heres the second issue After school Im kinda burnt out Ive never really left my comfort zone or the city and I feel travelling shoestring would be a good convoluted way to get out of my shell my parents shell and try something for myself My parents arent controlling btw theyre super supportive and I think I need to fend for myself I have an Irish passport which allows me to work anywhere in the EU and I have tons of family spread around the UK and Ireland And yes staying with extended family might qualify as a comfort zone but it would allow me to not worry about counting every penny I was planning on going in January 2023 saving up some money probably 10000 for a year maybe two So travelling would require 5k10k for one maybe two years School requires 10k20k one year for building up my portfolio and then another year after I apply to start AND THATS IF I GET IN ON THE FIRST TRY If I travel for a year or two it pushes me back further graduating somewhere between 20262028 if I get in on my first application If I got in after I finish University I would graduate in 2026 hopefully So to sum up my dilemma while Im worried about saving up money if I go to school first I feel that I would be too old to travel afterwards But if I travelled beforehand I would be graduating school somewhere between 2729 years of age AND I dont think Id be able to save up enough moneybuild up my portfolio if I travelled beforehand I wanna find myself and see a bit of the world but I want to get into this art world If I travel the first Id be finishing my education 2729 years old with little money and everyone ahead of me If I travel after around 26 years I fear Id be too old and I feel it be counterintuitive travelling after graduating from a prestigious school with all the industry hookups TLDR 21 yr old Saving money is hard what shall I do first Animation school is a long process to get in and complete vs Travelling in the EU with an Irish passport finding myself PS some may say start saving now and working on the portfolio now Im gonna do that but to make this post simple Im gonna act as if I start the second I graduate,Animation School vs Travel Somewhat long need advice,752

11633,travel,We recently booked a vacation rental through Vrbo for 12 days Unfortunately the place was terrible Doesnt matter why but we felt it was grossly misrepresented Vrbo told us it was between us and the owner so we tried to reconcile Owner told us we could get a refund if we canceled and they were able to rent it out again before the end of our trip We knew that would never happen so we tried to stick it out it got to us though and we finally decided to go somewhere else eat the cost and be happy on our vacation for once Out of politeness we informed the owner that we were checking out early They said no problem go ahead and cancel it Well… it turns out when you cancel a stay—even after you have started staying there—you can no longer review the unit I had no idea this was the case we got played hard by the owner We figured it would be doing them a favor so they could clean it up and rent it again but we had no idea just how big of a favor it would be I dont know how often something like this might happen but it does make me question Vrbos review system This place had one 5star review Have there been others who rented this place who fell for the same thing To me this is a misguided policy that can be a major loophole for owners I wanted to make sure fellow travelers were aware of this in case they encounter a similar situation,I just learned about a Vrbo policy that will keep me from using them ever again,267

11881,travel,TLDR my gf is visiting me in the US from Canada and is overstaying her visa by one day due to flight complications Will this affect her next year when she returns to the US for the summer Has anybody else from Canada been in a similar situation and what was your experience My gf is currently visiting me in LA California from Canada Its her first time ever leaving the country She arrived on May 8 with no return flight booked because we were considering having her take a semester off school and stay a couple extra months but hadnt yet decided This made the CBP officer at the airport suspicious and after a lot of questioning he eventually agreed to allow her to stay for 3 months as opposed to the usual 6 until August 8th Unfortunately we already had plans to attend a festival in SLC Utah on August 6th and 7th Tickets purchased and Airbnb booked After a lot of searching and scouring our options we finally found a flight that would leave from LA at 1030 pm on August 8th giving us time to drive home and get her on the flight Last night the airline canceled that flight and rescheduled it for 115 pm and added an 18 hour layover in Toronto Itd be impossible to make that drive in time on top of making arrangements for her to stay in Toronto so we opted out of the flight and searched for other options There is no flight that leaves from LA late enough for us to make it on time All flights leaving from SLC either have an overnight layover somewhere else in the US or drop her off in Canada a 6 hour drive from her destination So we decided the best course of action would be to book a flight for the morning of August 9th from LA Ive been researching the laws of overstaying your B2 visa for hours and have concluded that as long as her overstay is for less than 180 days she is not barred from entry at a later date However it will be on her record that she overstayed and it will be up to the CBP officers discretion if he chooses to see it as an issue and deny her entry on a future visit The first CBP officer who questioned her originally wasnt very friendly despite granting her entry He tore through her baggage scrolled through her personal texts checked her online bank statements and had a very accusatory tone He was prepared to send her back home claiming she didnt have the funds to sustain herself in the US even though I was funding her entire trip and was disbelieving of her story of our relationship Fortunately she was able to text me and I transferred her a large sum of money which seemed to satisfy the officer He did however tell her that he was granting her a trial run and that if she overstayed her visit she would never be allowed back in the US again The officers attitude toward her is making me very nervous to have her stay even just one day past her visa Has anybody from Canada been in a similar situation What was your experience upon reentry to the US Any and all information is immensely appreciated,Overstaying B2 Visa by One Day,562

12469,travel,It was supposed to be a 2hour flight from Nantes France to Tangier Morocco It was supposed to take off at 8pm and land at 10 It started with a confusing and poorly managed luggage checkin with intertwined lines of people all over the place and our plane took off from Nantes 2 hours late Then once we got to the Moroccan border Tangiers airport ended up refusing to let our plane land so we had to land in Malagaat 130 in the morning to stay at a hotelall paid for by Volotea So picture this it is now 4 in the morning 180 confused and tired passengersthe majority didnt speak a word of spanish in a hotel lobby being given their room keys one by one dozens of children crying their eyes out from hunger exhaustion and heat and a lot of people including women were given rooms where they would have to sleep with complete strangers It wasnt until the next day about 24 hours later that we finally got a flight for Tangier Now my question is why would you let one of your planes go up in the air and fly for 2 hours without the certainty that our destination would allow us to land in the first fucking place It gets even weirder when you see that there was a NantesCasablanca flight earlier that same day and that one didnt have any problem whatsoever I cant believe I paid 230 euros for this ordeal Volotea is a completely irresponsible airline and the damage control they tried to do by buying us a hotel room and lunch and apologizing through text messages does not change that in the slightest Avoid this airline at all costs if you plan on getting on a plane in western Europe This flight was an absolute disaster every single step of the way,Rant Worst flight experience Ive ever had courtesy of Voloteaspanish airline,312

12612,travel,I travelled last summer here and I am really excited to share with others the view I have experienced myself We went there with a couple of friends and stayed only 2 days the island is so small you can see it all probably in 45 days I am considering if you actually are doing some activities going to restaurants laying on the beach swimming and relaxing This way you can enjoy it to the fullest and understand the magic that its offering Seeing with your eyes is cool feeling what you see its a totally different experience You will return home with a calmer mind a more adventurous heart and a dreamy mood The island can be accessed only by the ferry then consider renting a car after you get on the island because its not so walkable and it is easier to move around and see multiple things a day There are buses too but I did not use them so I cannot tell much about it For the first time in my life I saw naturally colored clay That was awesome to experience My friends told me thats what companies use for making beauty products like facial scrubsmasks The water is absolutely clear and very appealing to swim in it As a fun activity we tried jet skiing That was my first time too I really enjoyed it because it was on an open ocean with huge waves which made my jet ski fly a bit and sometimes dive into the water splashing myself all over Get glasses it will help maneuvering it better I was always with closed eyes because of the waves coming so high,Massachusetts Marthas Vineyard,280

13034,travel,While vaccines are starting to be administered in several countries the coronavirus COVID19 situation continues to have a major effect on travel with many now looking to understand if when or how their travels might be feasible Accordingly rtravel is continue its megathreads on a monthly basis until the crisis dissipates In the interest of reducing the number of oneoff questions before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following Are borders open What entry or transit restrictions are in place Will I need to quarantine A list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources including from IATA Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures You may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country Because information can change on short notice it is important to verify the latest information ideally from government sources in the US At the time of writing foreign nationals are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in or transited via Brazil China India Iran Ireland the Schengen Area South Africa or the UK in the preceding 14 days Exceptions to this rule include green card holders some family members of US citizens and permanent residents and holders of certain visas eg F1 visas when traveling from the Schengen Area and K1 visas Note that except for of course US citizens this is not a citizenshipbased restriction it is purely based on travel history Because of this those traveling from one of the restricted countries are permitted to enter the US provided they spend the prior two weeks in a nonrestricted country More information about the entry restrictions and the associated proclamations is available on the US CDC website All air passengers – regardless of origin nationality and vaccination status – need to produce a negative result from a viral test taken within 3 days of the first flight on a single ticket to the US Alternatively you may travel with a positive test result from the previous 3 months and a letter from a doctor indicating that youre clear for travel The land borders with Mexico and Canada are closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes but air rail and sea but not commuter rail or ferry portsofentry remain open to nonessential travel No nationwide quarantine requirements exist Some individual states andor cities may have their own guidelines even for domestic travel so you will need to confirm with information from your destination state or city However at this point these quarantine guidelines are primarily recommendations instead of requirements with those for Hawaii being the major exception Note also that COVID tests are not being demanded at checkin security boarding or arrival for domestic travel within the contiguous United States and checkpoints are not being set up at state borders For more information see the US CDCs COVID19 page in Canada At the time of writing foreign nationals are barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for certain mostly essential reasons regardless of mode of travel Those traveling from countries other than the US must also fulfill one of several additional categories of exemptions Those who are permitted to travel to Canada for nonessential purposes include – aside from Canadians – permanent residents and certain family members of Canadians and permanent residents Note that Canadian airlines will be halting flights to Mexico and the Caribbean Those wishing to travel to Canada on compassionate reasons may do so provided they receive authorization from the Public Health Agency of Canada Fully airside international transits are typically permitted All passengers five years or older arriving into Canada by air will also need to produce a negative result from a PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to boarding the last direct flight to Canada Alternatively you may submit a positive COVID19 molecular test taken between 14 and 90 days prior to departure Note that Passengers are required to take an additional test on arrival and quarantine at hotels for at least three days pending negative test results in one of four cities – Vancouver Calgary Toronto and Montreal – that will serve as the only portsofentry by air After being permitted to exit hotel quarantine travelers must continue to selfquarantine until 14 days after arrival at which point they must take another test The whole process is expected to cost approximately C2000 per passenger which travelers will have to pay For more information see the Canadian governments COVID19 travel restrictions page in Mexico At the time of writing there are no changes to Mexicos standard entry requirements However the land border with the United States is officially closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes Travelers must fill out a Questionnaire of Identification of Risk Factors in Travelers available here to present upon arrival There are no quarantine or testing requirements upon arrival in Mexico For more information see information provided by Mexican embassies including the Mexican Embassy in the Netherlands in the UK At the time of writing foreign nationals are barred from entering the UK if they have entered or transited several several countries including but not limited to South American countries South Asian countries Panama Qatar Turkey the UAE and several countries in southern Africa within the previous 10 days are not permitted to enter the UK The full red list of countriesredlist is subject to change Irish citizens and those with UK resident permits are in addition to UK nationals exempted from this restriction All passengers entering or transiting through the UK from outside the Common Travel Area which comprises the UK Ireland the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands need to produce a negative PCR LAMP or antigen test taken within 3 days of their last direct flight or other mode of transit to the UK Those who have only beentransited in green list countriesgreenlist in the previous ten days are not required to quarantine although they must still take a COVID19 test the second day after arrival The restriction is based on travel history not nationality All other international arrivals including UK citizens will need to quarantine for 10 days after arrival Passengers who have not beentransited in any of the red list countries over the previous ten days may shorten their quarantines in England if they test negative at least 5 days into their quarantine period In England passengers are also permitted to leave quarantine to depart the countryquarantinefor10daysafteryouarrive Unless falling under the green list exemption all travelers regardless of nationality coming from outside the Common Travel Area will in addition to getting tested before departure need to take a test on the second and eighth days after arrival These tests need to be prebooked before departure All travelers that have beentransited in any of the red list countries over the previous ten days must book at their own expense a hotel room for their quarantine For those destined for Scotland all travelers who have been outside the Common Travel Area in the previous ten days must book a hotel room for their quarantines These hotel rooms must be booked in advance along with the mandatory tests on the second and eighth days of quarantine With lockdown measures in place within the UK there may be restrictions on travel purposes to from or within the constituent countries For example travel to and from Scotland is prohibited except for limited purposes For more information see UK Border Control and the UK governments information about travel measures in the EU In the Schengen Area In late June 2020 the European Commission recommended that external borders be reopened to shortterm visitors arriving from several countries deemed to have adequately maintained the virus This list has been updated as of Jun 16 to consist of Albania Australia China including Hong Kong and Macau with mainland China subject to confirmation of reciprocity Israel Japan Lebanon New Zealand North Macedonia Rwanda Serbia Singapore South Korea Thailand and the US This list however is nonbinding among member countries and is subject to change Nevertheless several countries within the EU or the Schengen Area have used this list as guidance permitting arrivals from these countries as well as EU countries which includes EU and Schengen countries and sometimes the UK These restrictions typically are not based on nationality but rather travel history andor residency consult resources from your destination country However multiple EU countries have temporarily placed additional restrictions on travel from specific countries eg the UK or have reinstated broad restrictions for those from outside the EU the Schengen Area or their own countries due to discoveries of new COVID variants Fully airside nonSchengen to nonSchengen transits are typically permitted but confirm and consult resources from your transit country to see if further documentation which may at times include negative test results is required For example Germanys transit requirements are discussed heref14745744 and herecontent5 In May 2021 the European Commission recommended EU states loosen travel restrictions including by allowing vaccinated travelers to travel to Europe this summer However details about these plans are still being unveiled and each EU country has the ultimate say on its border policies Among the European countries that have reopened to vaccinated travelers are Francesommaire1 although with limitations from red countries Greece Iceland and Spain This list is not exhaustive and some countries are also loosening some restrictions for unvaccinated tourists As the various EU and Schengen countries have opened their external borders to thirdcountry nationals in various ways and with different exceptions it is imperative that travelers check the entry requirements for their portsofentry A summary of travel restrictions is provided by the European Union but many have reported that government eg embassy or foreign ministry resources have been more detailed and accurate in South Korea At the time of writing most nationalities with visafree or visawaiver arrangements with Korea have had their visafreewaiver status suspended primarily on the basis of the reciprocal entry restrictions for Korean citizens There are also additional entry and transit restrictions of those traveling from China All passengers must have a negative LAMP PCR SDA or TMA test taken within 72 hours of departure of the first flight en route to Korea International arrivals with very few exceptions will be required to quarantine for 14 days nonresidents will be required to quarantine in government facilities at their own expense For more information see the Korea Immigration Service in Japan At the time of writing foreign nationals who have been in one of 150 countries for purposes other than transit are not permitted to enter Japan Further visas and visa exemptions for nationals from many countries have been suspended Permanent residents longterm residents and spouses and children of Japanese citizens may be exempt from these entry restrictions provided they meet certain conditions Those individuals including Japanese citizens that are permitted to enter Japan will be required to undergo a 14day quarantine All travelers will be required to provide proof of a negative result from a test taken within 72 hours of departure for Japan Additional restrictions are in place for those travelling from the UK or South Africa For more information see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan in Thailand At the time of writing Thailand is accepting travelers that have the proper visa or are visaexempt Visaonarrival facilities as well as visaexempt status for nationals of Cambodia and Myanmar are suspended Travelers entering or transiting Thailand must have a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of the first embarkation point All travelers entering the country are subject to a 14day quarantine Foreigners must have a confirmed hotel reservation for their quarantine and well as health insurance with coverage of at least US100000 When will borders reopen or travel restrictions be lifted Is it safea good idea to book travel for a particular time months ahead It is of course impossible to say when travel restrictions are lifted for every country Where no news has been officially provided it is often very difficult to predict as countries will make decisions based on the progress of the pandemic – which is an unknown – as well as other pressures eg economic or social Consider that the progress of the pandemic and efforts to combat it are unpredictable Countries are approaching the vaccine rollouts in different ways Some countries are exempting vaccinated travelers from testing or quarantine requirements and some are even allowing vaccinated travelers to enter when they would not admit unvaccinated travelers However one should not assume special treatment on account of your vaccinated status as most countries still have not differentiated between vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers In the meantime with the resurgences of cases and new variants recently discovered in several countries some countries have firmed up travel restrictions requiring additional tests or quarantine periods or preventing travel from certain locations Further even if you are ultimately able to travel to your destination there may be lockdowns or widespread closures of businesses and places of interest Realize that you are taking a risk by deciding to speculatively book travel in the hopes that travel restrictions will be lifted by the time you travel or even will remain as liberal as they are in your destination today With this unprecedented situation old adages about when its best to purchase airfare may no longer be valid In any event be aware of the policies of your airlines and accommodations for credits andor refunds should you need to reschedule or cancel Further understand that airlines may make it very difficult to receive a refund even if legally required Many travelers have reported waiting months to receive refunds on cancelled flights or otherwise being stonewalled when requesting a refund And be aware that if your airline goes out of business your funds could be lost forever Take note of your jurisdictions laws regarding refunds for cancelled flights For example US Dept of Transportation Refunds EU Air passenger rights So should I cancel a trip that Ive already booked And how Will insurance help These questions were covered at length in the second megathread Although countries may be starting to reopen the points therein are still relevant

13567,travel,I might need to address the fact that Ive lived in different countries and places for the last 4 years its related to this situation Its not the first time this happens I feel the need to get in touch with people I met in previous years months weeks I get in contact with them I sent a message they reply back and we share a few bits of our lives After a while weeks months years the communication vanishes I move to another country orand another lifestyle Then I am present in my current present therefore I also allow the communication to vanish due to understanding that in part is pointless to “stay in touch” because texts or video calls dont make it justice to be with them and share a moment together This has happened several times with various people over the last 34 years Its inevitable to lose people When traveling I have met a lot of people they are all so culturally different from each other and unique so many of them inspired me in so many different ways a lot of them have caused me a very positive impression and therefore my memories carry such a strong positive reaction just by thinking of a lot of them After seeing how many people have just vanished from my life a part of me is getting tired of it I also realize Im part of the problem as well I know Ive held myself from showing enough authenticity and honesty with everyone I meet I am aware Ive made mistakes Ive met people before that could potentially be a great influence in my life but after showing toxic patterns or irresponsible actions eventually and understandably they have gone out of my life At the end of the day I cant control 100 how many people stay in my life or how good the relationships are All I can control is how much courage I get to show authenticity and honesty and how I react to the situation Its funny I realize Ive experienced this same situation all my life but since I travel the weight of the matter has become more obvious Just think about how many people I met during university or even before that Now they could not be less relevant in my life I feel the need to let this out with all of you If I ever meet you one day please be assured Im eager to grow and learn every day Im happier and less perfect the most significant way Ive learned how to become a better version of myself is by making tons of mistakes and accepting them It all starts from acceptance Then the rest falls in place… If this resonates with you dont doubt in sharing with me that badass and amazing smile you hide Much love to you,I have naturally lost tons of people throughout my life since traveling the weight of the matter has become more obvious,480

14191,travel,Hey Ive been thinking about going to either Costa Rica or South Africa from around mid july to mid august I was wondering considering the seasons which one should I go to In Costa Rica it would be the green season but apparently its not that big of an issue as it mostly rains at night or in the evenings And the nature is more luxurious than during the dry season Thats what Ive read but idk if its the reality of it In South Africa it would be winter The temperature doesnt bother me quite the opposite it doesnt go that low and apparently its the best time to observe the wildlife not only terrestrial but also marine with the whales But the days will be shorter and the sun would set down pretty early Would it be bothering Which one would be preferable In terms of scenery and wildlife observation both seem to be amazing Thanks,Costa Rica or South Africa,158

14494,travel,My fiancée and I are trying to get married this summer Im Canadian and shes Filipino so neither of us can visit the others country Fortunately conditions have made it possible for us to be together for the first time in over a year and were presently in Dubai My fiancée is the same woman Ive called my wife in other Reddit posts but unfortunately were not actually married yet I wish we had married in 2019 when it would have been easier and we could have had family present Since arriving weve consulted a UAE legal firm about the possibility of marrying here As a rule of thumb its not generally possible for two UAE nonresidents to marry in the UAE There is a way around it though the lawyer tells us it can be done through the court in the emirate of Ajman However this requires at least one of us to request a visit visa to Ajman Authority and we cannot currently do this because we are already in the UAE A marriage in the UAE would also require permission from my fiancées father and as he cannot come to the UAE we would need to obtain a power of attorney from him and to get that POA and her CENOMAR Certificate of No Marriage Record authorized at the UAE embassy in the Philippines before coming to the UAE In short its not an option for us currently but it might be an option of last resort a few months in the future Our backup plan was Thailand We can both enter Thailand if were willing to endure a twoweek quarantine and under normal circumstances its not hard for foreigners to marry there But I recently learned from the Canadian Embassy in Bangkok that all the amphurs in Bangkokthe district registration offices where marriages are performed and made legalare currently closed and nobody knows when they will open again I may be mistaken but I think this means that even native Thais currently cant marry in Thailand So now were casting about for another country accessible from Dubai where its relatively easy for a Filipino to enter and where it might be possible for us to marry I think Armenia and the Ukraine might be amenable to issuing eVisas to Filipinos on relatively short notice while were still in Dubai but Im still investigating that I dont yet know whether nonresidents can marry in either country Anybody have any ideas about this Advice would be very welcome Note some countries make it easy for Filipinos to visit if they already have a visa to the US UK Ireland or a Schengen country Unfortunately my fiancée does not have that So it seems Turkey is probably not an option at least not without returning to the Philippines and spending more than a month in the visa application process Its a shame that events are preventing us from getting married and starting a family,Our international quest to get married and a request for advice,495

14633,travel,My husband and I are going to Greece from July 2nd12th During our trip we have a domestic flight booked from July 9th11th on SkyExpress There were a lot of issues booking this domestic flight and my ticket ended up with my married name My passport was never switched over when I got married so now my ticket and passport do not match I have tried reaching out to SkyExpress multiple times through phone calls emails social media messages etc however I have not been able to reach anyone Based on online reviews this is very common and their customer service is basically nonexistent I ended up calling my CC company Chase and disputing the charge The man I spoke to was very encouraging refunded my money for the time being and submitted a dispute I received a letter stating The merchants can provide information supporting the charges during the next two billing periods If they do not respond during that period our credits will remain on your account I am somewhat confident that they will not respond given my experience thus far Here is the thing I have no clue what to do now We fly in less than two billing periods and I do not what to end up either flightless or out another 400 The options seem to be 1 Booking another non refundable flight on a new airline and hoping that our dispute gets approved 2 Booking another non refundable flight on the same airline and hoping that our dispute gets approved 3 Pay an undisclosed fee to delete and re add me as a passenger under the correct name I am leaning towards 3 for obvious reasons but I am confused to say the least What happens if we do 3 take the flight and then the dispute is approved in two billing cycles I am not trying to scam anyone but I also dont understand how it works,Disputing airline charge with CC companywhat do I do,324

14636,travel,Ive had this dream for a while because I am in love with differences in culture politics and I want to live a life where I get to experience as many different ideologies as I can A while back I did a project for my geography class about traveling to North Korea and I discovered Koryo Tours A full tour in mid aprilmost important date on the north Korean calendar was said to be starting from around 1100person The itinerary looked amazing to me and since then I couldnt part with this idea A little background I am 16 and I am pretty new in the world of traveling and I also am from a country which doesnt really have opportunities for earning money at such a young age So if I manage to make this dream come true Id like it to he worth every penny Now my question is what other touring options do I have Are there less expensive ones What level of honesty can I expect from the price I listed above and lastly would I be able to travel there if for example I am 17 traveling with a friend who is 18 Would he count as an adult being able to take responsibility of me I am aware of the fact that most touring groups dont accept people under the age of 18 but by the amount this trip costs I figure Im gonna turn 18 by the time I get all the money for it,I want to travel to North Korea but I dont know where to start,252
14639,travel,Hello my family has a 3 leg trip in a week and a half and the airline Turkish Airlines just cancelled the 2nd leg 1 SF ATH 2 ATH IST 3 IST ATH As a side note the cancellation was just noted in a form email noting a status change It would have been easy to miss The context here is on the date of the cancelled leg I have a nonrefundable flight from Crete to Athens booked on a seperate airline on a seperate ticket required because Turkish Airlines wont cover this location itself or with partner airlines This means I can only catch one of the other flights between ATH IST on that day TK9192 without eating big to book new tickets out of Crete from scratch last minute No problem Ill just switch to that one flight Turkish airlines website errors out and cant make any change Turkish Airlines on the phone said they wont put me on that flight because its operated by other airlines must be a code share The only option they gave is a very early flight I cant make because of flight out of Crete or to completely cancelrefund the entire ticket all legs I could only escalate to an email address and no responses so far Any other suggestions as to how to convince the airline to just move us at its cost to their own coded flight code share earlier that day I could potentially go down to SF airport but that is a big big headache ps no reason for cancellation provided in email or on the phone when asked It seems they just are saving costs,Airline cancels mid leg of 3 leg trip for no stated reason and limits rebooking how to resolve,278

15377,travel,I dont know who needs this story but if youre considering booking with Aeromexico please read and reconsider Backstory In January 2020 I got a notice for a cheap flight to Quito and booked it for Thanksgiving 2020 despite saying Id never fly Aeromexico again after a 2017 trip to Mexico City because the customer service was the worst Id ever had Obviously 2020 canceled everything As soon as my trip was canceled in 2020 I tried to get my money back because I knew I didnt want to fly Aeromexico again They refused and after a few months I accepted credit Then I used the credits to book a flight to Colombia and paid an extra 480 to make sure my flight would be fully refundable with no fees or penalties We had to cancel that one too because while our situation improved theirs had not I decided to rebook Ecuador and was hit with increased fares and change fees despite having paid the extra 480 to make sure there would be no change fees I ate the 700 because I was dying to go but I also felt salty that my bargain trip was becoming pretty pricey Fast forward to today Im in an overpriced airport hotel in Mexico because Aeromexico blamed me for the fact that I didnt make my connection in Mexico City to Quito Let me start at 1030 am I arrived at the San Antonio airport for my 130 flight I was early because my app wouldnt give me my MexicoQuito boarding pass The woman who helped me kept us at the counter ‘til 1152 and ended up saying “We cant print it here you have to get it printed in Mexico It wont be a problem” Long story short it was a problem We landed around 340 in Mexico City but we had to wait for one of those buses and by the time we got to customs it was 415 Our connecting flight left at 630 The line was long and it was515 by the time we got to the connecting flight area where we were turned away for not having printed boarding passes and were sent to ticketing We waited in the line for tickets only to be told that we needed to go to lane 63 where there was a long line We missed the flight and were told to go to a different counter to book another Ok this happens but we figured we would be ok It was 840 before we reached the counter There we were impolitely informed that we had plenty of time to make this flight and would need to pay change fees another 700 to arrive 24 hours later When we asked for a supervisor she spoke to my wife in a manner I would consider too condescending for a toddler belittled us both suggested that my wife was blocking her path and walked away So now Im in an overpriced hotel room and just got off the phone with Aeromexico I told them we just want to go home We have no faith that the same thing wont happen on the way back and we simply dont have the money for 700 change fees each way They said there are no available flights until after we were set to return including our flight that we have tickets for Apparently we cant use those seats that are assigned to us to get home even if we wait Side note We are an interracial lesbian couple We arent sure if racism sexism or homophobia were relevant here but its hard not to wonder,Well that was a rough one Trigger Warning Aeromexico,608

15702,travel,Hello my girlfriend and I just booked flights to Naples and will be there for 8 nights in July August For those that have been to the region was hoping to get some advice on which towns to see where to stay and how much time to dedicate to each area Given the shorter duration of our trip we think we will skip Naples and Pompeii and focus our trip on Capri and Amalfi coast Initial plan is to split time between two Airbnbs one in Capri and one somewhere along Amalfi Coast We could use help with the following questions Is 34 nights on Capri too many Where is a good home base along Amalfi Coast What towns along Amalfi Coast should we prioritize visiting Any general advice on transportation while in area rent a car or scooter recs on ferrys etc A bit more about us we are in our 20s and would consider ourselves adventurous travelers Can enjoy a couple hours at the beach but prefer to be on our feet exploring and have action packed days Love hikes and outdoor attractions but can also get lost exploring a cool village for a couple hours Not huge history buffs so wont go out of our way for those sites but will stop along way if convenient Would rather pick 23 areas and make most of our time there rather than try to jam in every region and spend lots of time in transit hence not planning on dedicating time to Naples or Pompeii Early in our planning and would appreciate any suggestions Thanks everyone,Advice on Capri Amalfi Coast,267

16031,travel,While vaccines are starting to be administered in several countries the coronavirus COVID19 situation continues to have a major effect on travel with many now looking to understand if when or how their travels might be feasible Accordingly rtravel is continue its megathreads on a monthly basis until the crisis dissipates In the interest of reducing the number of oneoff questions before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following Are borders open What entry or transit restrictions are in place Will I need to quarantine A list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources including from IATA or Kayaks travel restriction map Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures You may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country Because information can change on short notice it is important to verify the latest information ideally from government sources in the US At the time of writing foreign nationals are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in or transited via Brazil China India Iran Ireland the Schengen Area South Africa or the UK in the preceding 14 days Exceptions to this rule include green card holders some family members of US citizens and permanent residents and holders of certain visas eg F1 visas when traveling from the Schengen Area and K1 visas Note that except for of course US citizens this is not a citizenshipbased restriction it is purely based on travel history Because of this those traveling from one of the restricted countries are permitted to enter the US provided they spend the prior two weeks in a nonrestricted country More information about the entry restrictions and the associated proclamations is available on the US CDC website All air passengers including US citizens and green card holders regardless of origin and nationality need to produce a negative result from a viral test taken within 3 days of the first flight on a single ticket to the US Alternatively you may travel with a positive test result from the previous 3 months and a letter from a doctor indicating that youre clear for travel The land borders with Mexico and Canada are closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes but air rail and sea but not commuter rail or ferry portsofentry remain open to nonessential travel No nationwide quarantine requirements exist although an executive order signed on Jan 21 hinted at the possibility of one being instituted should the CDC recommend it Nevertheless individual states andor cities may have their own requirements even for domestic travel so you will need to confirm with information from your destination state or city As an example this is New York States travel advisoryquarantine page note that travelers are permitted to break quarantine to leave New York State and the states quarantine restrictions would not prevent you from boarding a connecting flight New Yorks testing and quarantine requirements are ending for domestic travelers as of Apr 1 Note also that COVID tests are not being demanded at checkin security boarding or arrival for domestic travel within the contiguous United States and checkpoints arent being set up at state borders For more information see the US CDCs COVID19 page in Canada At the time of writing foreign nationals are barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for certain mostly essential reasons regardless of mode of travel Those traveling from countries other than the US must also fulfill one of several additional categories of exemptions Those who are permitted to travel to Canada for nonessential purposes include – aside from Canadians – permanent residents and certain family members of Canadians and permanent residents Note that Canadian airlines will be halting flights to Mexico and the Caribbean Those wishing to travel to Canada on compassionate reasons may do so provided they receive authorization from the Public Health Agency of Canada Fully airside international transits are typically permitted All passengers five years or older arriving into Canada by air will also need to produce a negative result from a PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to boarding the last direct flight to Canada Alternatively you may submit a positive COVID19 molecular test taken between 14 and 90 days prior to departure Note that Passengers are required to take an additional test on arrival and quarantine at hotels for at least three days pending negative test results in one of four cities – Vancouver Calgary Toronto and Montreal – that will serve as the only portsofentry by air After being permitted to exit hotel quarantine travelers must continue to selfquarantine until 14 days after arrival at which point they must take another test The whole process is expected to cost approximately C2000 per passenger which travelers will have to pay For more information see the Canadian governments COVID19 travel restrictions page in Mexico At the time of writing there are no changes to Mexicos standard entry requirements However the land border with the United States is officially closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes Travelers must fill out a Questionnaire of Identification of Risk Factors in Travelers available here to present upon arrival There are no quarantine or testing requirements upon arrival in Mexico For more information see information provided by Mexican embassies including the Mexican Embassy in the Netherlands in the UK At the time of writing foreign nationals are barred from entering the UK if they have entered or transited several several countries including but not limited to South American countries South Asian countries except Sri Lanka Panama Qatar Turkey the UAE and several countries in southern Africa within the previous 10 days are not permitted to enter the UK The full red list of countriesredlist is subject to change Irish citizens and those with UK resident permits are in addition to UK nationals exempted from this restriction All passengers entering or transiting through the UK from outside the Common Travel Area which comprises the UK Ireland the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands need to produce a negative PCR LAMP or antigen test taken within 3 days of their last direct flight or other mode of transit to the UK Those who have only beentransited in green list countriesgreenlist in the previous ten days are not required to quarantine although they must still take a COVID19 test the second day after arrival The restriction is based on travel history not nationality All other international arrivals including UK citizens will need to quarantine for 10 days after arrival Passengers who have not beentransited in any of the red list countries over the previous ten days may shorten their quarantines in England if they test negative at least 5 days into their quarantine period Unless falling under the green list exemption all travelers regardless of nationality coming from outside the Common Travel Area will in addition to getting tested before departure need to take a test on the second and eighth days after arrival These tests need to be prebooked before departure All travelers that have beentransited in any of the red list countries over the previous ten days must book at their own expense a hotel room for their quarantine For those destined for Scotland all travelers who have been outside the Common Travel Area in the previous ten days must book a hotel room for their quarantines These hotel rooms must be booked in advance along with the mandatory tests on the second and eighth days of quarantine With lockdown measures in place within the UK there may be restrictions on travel purposes to from or within the constituent countries For example travel to and from Scotland is prohibited except for limited purposes For more information see UK Border Control and the UK governments information about travel measures in the EU In the Schengen Area In late June 2020 the European Commission recommended that external borders be reopened to shortterm visitors arriving from several countries deemed to have adequately maintained the virus This list has been updated as of Jan 28 to consist of Australia China subject to confirmation of reciprocity New Zealand Rwanda Singapore South Korea and Thailand This list however is nonbinding among member countries and is subject to change Nevertheless several countries within the EU or the Schengen Area have used this list as guidance permitting arrivals from these countries as well as EU countries which includes EU and Schengen countries and sometimes the UK These restrictions typically are not based on nationality but rather travel history andor residency consult resources from your destination country However multiple EU countries have temporarily placed additional restrictions on travel from specific countries eg the UK or have reinstated broad restrictions for those from outside the EU the Schengen Area or their own countries due to discoveries of new COVID variants Fully airside nonSchengen to nonSchengen transits are typically permitted but confirm and consult resources from your transit country to see if further documentation which may at times include negative test results is required Recent reports from a European Commission official suggest that vaccinated travelers will be permitted to travel to Europe this summer However firm details about these plans have not been announced and each EU country has the ultimate say on its border policies Among the European countries that have made announcements about possibly reopening to vaccinated travelers are France targeting Jun 9 Greece already open if traveling from certain countries and Iceland already open As the various EU and Schengen countries have opened their external borders to thirdcountry nationals in various ways and with different exceptions it is imperative that travelers check the entry requirements for their portsofentry A summary of travel restrictions is provided by the European Union but many have reported that government eg embassy or foreign ministry resources have been more detailed and accurate in South Korea At the time of writing most nationalities with visafree or visawaiver arrangements with Korea have had their visafreewaiver status suspended primarily on the basis of the reciprocal entry restrictions for Korean citizens There are also additional entry and transit restrictions of those traveling from China All passengers must have a negative LAMP PCR SDA or TMA test taken within 72 hours of departure of the first flight en route to Korea International arrivals with very few exceptions will be required to quarantine for 14 days nonresidents will be required to quarantine in government facilities at their own expense For more information see the Korea Immigration Service in Japan At the time of writing foreign nationals who have been in one of 150 countries for purposes other than transit are not permitted to enter Japan Further visas and visa exemptions for nationals from many countries have been suspended Permanent residents longterm residents and spouses and children of Japanese citizens may be exempt from these entry restrictions provided they meet certain conditions Those individuals including Japanese citizens that are permitted to enter Japan will be required to undergo a 14day quarantine All travelers will be required to provide proof of a negative result from a test taken within 72 hours of departure for Japan Additional restrictions are in place for those travelling from the UK or South Africa For more information see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan in Thailand At the time of writing Thailand is accepting travelers that have the proper visa or are visaexempt Visaonarrival facilities as well as visaexempt status for nationals of Cambodia and Myanmar are suspended Travelers entering or transiting Thailand must have a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of the first embarkation point All travelers entering the country are subject to a 14day quarantine Foreigners must have a confirmed hotel reservation for their quarantine and well as health insurance with coverage of at least US100000 When will borders reopen or travel restrictions be lifted Is it safea good idea to book travel for a particular time months ahead It is of course impossible to say when travel restrictions are lifted for every country Where no news has been officially provided it is often very difficult to predict as countries will make decisions based on the progress of the pandemic – which is an unknown – as well as other pressures eg economic or social Consider that the progress of the pandemic and efforts to combat it are unpredictable Countries are approaching the vaccine rollouts in different ways Some countries are exempting vaccinated travelers from testing or quarantine requirements and some are even allowing vaccinated travelers to enter when they would not admit unvaccinated travelers However one should not assume special treatment on account of your vaccinated status as most countries still have not differentiated between vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers In the meantime with the resurgences of cases and new variants recently discovered in several countries some countries have firmed up travel restrictions requiring additional tests or quarantine periods or preventing travel from certain locations Further even if you are ultimately able to travel to your destination there may be lockdowns or widespread closures of businesses and places of interest Realize that you are taking a risk by deciding to speculatively book travel in the hopes that travel restrictions will be lifted by the time you travel or even will remain as liberal as they are in your destination today With this unprecedented situation old adages about when its best to purchase airfare may no longer be valid In any event be aware of the policies of your airlines and accommodations for credits andor refunds should you need to reschedule or cancel Further understand that airlines may make it very difficult to receive a refund even if legally required Many travelers have reported waiting months to receive refunds on cancelled flights or otherwise being stonewalled when requesting a refund And be aware that if your airline goes out of business your funds could be lost forever Take note of your jurisdictions laws regarding refunds for cancelled flights For example US Dept of Transportation Refunds EU Air passenger rights So should I cancel a trip that Ive already booked And how Will insurance help These questions were covered at length in the second megathread Although countries may be starting to reopen the points therein are still relevant Previous related megathreads First

16400,travel,Sometimes you watch a movie and it hits you so hard that you take parts of it with you everywhere you go in life And if youre really lucky that movie will also contain an incredible soundtrack full of soultouching songs that only continue to evoke the strong feelings the movie brought forth every time you listen to them For me that moviesoundtrack is Into the Wild And I want to share the story of how I brought this film and soundtrack to life for myself by taking my own journey to Alaska Into the Wild was originally a 1996 nonfiction book written by Jon Krakauer The book tells the story of Christopher McCandless a college graduate who sold all his belongings cut off contact with his family and traveled all around the United States before making his way to Alaska to live in the wilderness––where he spoiler alert ends up dying from starvation In 2007 the book was adapted into a film of the same name written coproduced and directed by Sean Penn The soundtrack is made up of songs performed by Eddie Vedder lead singer of Pearl Jam I read and watched Into the Wild just before going to college and was deeply captivated by the story and the soundtrack of the film which remains to this day one of my favorite albums Before going off to college I certainly had a sense of wanting to get out of my small town and see the world beyond my reach Watching this movie where Chris McCandless travels all over the country and meets people from all walks of life inspired me When I graduated college I moved back home to save some money and start to pay off my student loans After a while I decided to take some time to work remotely while traveling the country visiting places like Utah California and yes Alaska In order to be able to afford these travels I worked at various hostels scrubbing toilets and making beds in exchange for a free stay while working my fulltime remote job as well While it was draining to work so much on top of traveling I have no regrets and I know that being able to take this trip at all was a privilege Although I certainly had no intentions of venturing into the wild in the way that McCandless did I certainly felt the tug of going further and further north to experience the vast open space and sense of freedom I imagine McCandless felt I think most people that love the book or movie relate deeply to the feelings held by Chris the innate need to seek something much bigger to escape the bubble of a monotonous machinelike society and connect to a larger force at play These lyrics from the song Society on the soundtrack illustrate this feeling well When you want more than you have you think you need And when you think more than you want your thoughts begin to bleed I think I need to find a bigger place ‘Cause when you have more than you think you need more space If you talk to locals in Alaska about Into the Wild many folks roll their eyes––that is because many people come to Alaska after reading the book or watching the movie hoping to find the bus in which McCandless died In a way visiting the bus has become a pilgrimage of sorts for people who resonated with McCandlesss views and desires The locals told me that they disparaged these folks because they often tried to reach the bus without having adequate knowledge of how dangerous it is to do so––it is located in a clearing by the stampede trail near Denali National Park and hikers need to cross a treacherous river to reach it Several people have died trying to reach the bus and countless others have needed to be rescued via helicopter Note As of 2020 the bus has been removed from the wilderness due to the increasing deaths to the Museum of the North at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks Although I had no intentions of reaching the bus myself I was excited to discover that the bus shown in the movie was actually a replica and was located outside of 49th State Brewery in Healy Alaska just outside of Denali National Park I took a solo road trip from Anchorage to Denali and the experience alone was absolutely lifechanging Seeing the vastness of that national park took my breath away It made me feel so small and insignificant in the best way possible But having the opportunity to visit the replica of the bus was a very special experience for me During my trip to the park I connected with two other travelers who were equally compelled by the story and excited to visit the bus After a day of hiking together we went to the brewery talked about why we love Into the Wild over some flights of Alaskan beer and then got to check out the bus For the film the inside of the replica was made to look exactly like McCandlesss real bus and still remained that way with tidbits of information to read located around the bus In addition during my time in Denali National Park I spent a lot of time listening to the Into the Wild soundtrack The national park itself is 61 million acreslarger than New Hampshire––but the road that vehicles can travel on only goes 92 miles into the park Private vehicles are allowed to drive 15 miles in but after that you need to take a park bus if you want to go the full way in on the 92mile park road I got on a bus at 445 am one morning and rode it all the way into the park which took the entire day with several stops During parts of that ride I listened to the movie soundtrack as I looked out the window in awe Weed is legal in Alaska so I had conveniently brought some edibles with me to enjoy on the bus ride as well Im not even a little bit embarrassed to say that I teared up several times at the sheer beauty coupled with the meaningfulness that the soundtrack and story of Into the Wild holds for me As much as it may sound like a cliche taking this trip to Alaska was perhaps one of the most impactful things I have done in my life In fact before I took the solo road trip from Anchorage to Denali I was feeling really depressed and tired of the road––so much so that I considered booking a flight home early and cutting my travels short I am SO glad that I did not I am so grateful that I got to see with my own two eyes the place that tugs at so many people who long for something biggerincluding Chris McCandless and countless people who have been inspired by his story As I did some hikes through the park I continued to reflect a lot on my own life I thought about how much I missed having a home with a sense of community––or roots so to speak But I also was invigorated by the concept of rising––going higher and higher––literally through traveling up North through hiking but also figuratively by rising above challenges that I face and rising above the expectations that others place on me and that I place on myself for how life should be lived I thought about the dichotomy between the verbs root and rise as I hiked and I now have those words tattooed on each of my feet It is not a coincidence that one of my favorite songs off of the soundtrack is called “Rise” which includes these lyrics Such is the way of the world You can never know Just where to put all your faith And how will it grow Gonna rise up Burning black holes in dark memories Gonna rise up Turning mistakes into gold I am so grateful I was able to take this trip to bring to life the impact that the Into the Wild movie and soundtrack had on me It was a call to continue to reflect on why exactly Into the Wild touched me and many others Of course while Chriss life was inspiring to many his ultimate fatal downfall is not something to aspire to But what I latch onto is the lessons we can take away from this story––and that may look different for everyone But for me it is to remember to keep a sense of wonder by having a desire to always travel and to always keep exploring alive Like I said taking a trip such as this is a blessing and a privilege––but I do believe we can all keep this explorative ethos alive even in our everyday lives––exploring new places in our towns going out of our way to meet people who are different than us and deeply reflecting on what is meaningful to us and going after that Regardless of where we find ourselves displaying kindness and seeking to foster genuine human connections steeped in compassion can also take us to high places and be a type of creative exploration in itself To have a curious mind and take risks but still feel connected to that larger force of magic present in both nature and human connection These are the things that I take away from Into the Wild and my own personal experience with the story and soundtrack,Going Into the Wild How journeying to Alaska and the setting of Into the Wild changed my life,1605

16541,travel,So I recently graduated college and decided fuck a job I want to travel So at the moment I am living in my car whilst traveling about the US Its fun and all and I really enjoy exploring and seeing so many cool places and Im just getting started with my travels But fuck man its starting to get real lonely Ive always been a pretty quiet and introverted person and I usually prefer to be alone But as I hike across national parks and explore the streets of cities and see so many peopleall with other people together I get so lonely I really enjoy rooftopping parkour photography and all kinds of things but Ive always done these things alone Ive havent met many people that enjoy travel and adventuring the way I do and the people I do know that do these things already have their friend groups and everybody is best friends and I feel like an outsider always I really wish I had friends to do these things with and I know those people are out there too I just dont know how to find them or befriend them Ive always struggled to maintain friendships and Im starting to feel I might be alone my whole life I literally have 0 friends right now Which is 100 my fault because Im terribly picky about who I spend time with Its like the saying “no company is better than bad company” I feel like Im missing out on the most important part of life but am unable to actually do anything about it Maybe one day Ill meet some cool people I can connect with Until then Ill just keep putting one foot in front of the other on the lonely path Im on Not really sure what the point of this post is other than to just rant Maybe someone out there feels the same as me Maybe you have some lifechanging advice Either way thanks for stopping by,Mr Lonely,333

16578,travel,Im planning to take a vacation during the Summer of 2022 before I begin college in fullswing and probably wouldnt have another opportunity for several years As a result Im hoping to make the most of it which has led me to have a difficult time in planning any of the details Would anyone be willing to offer their thoughts My Timeframe would be 4 weeks 2 weeks for each country I want to visit starting in either the second half of June or the beginning of July the exact time I havent decided and would like thoughts on this My first location would be Italy since my uncles family lives there Id be staying with my uncle for the duration of my stay here so lodgings arent a problem Im hoping to explore the city of Rome the city my uncle lives in as well as Venice Id be open to other places The food budget would be roughly 50 USD per day since Im staking much of the experience in food this includes fancier dinners and wine Im not big on souvenirs but Ill take recommendations Ive estimated that a flight to Italy would cost roughly 1200 for an upgraded seat My budget for Italy would be roughly 3000 though I can adjust that if necessary My other location after Italy would be Japan since Ive wanted to explore it for such a long time My plan is to start in Tokyo and end in Kyoto Im open to other places though Yudanaka Takayama and Hiroshima interest me Im having a hard time estimating a flight from Italy to Japan so Im assuming around 1500 since thats the cost to fly from Seattle a few hour from where I live to Tokyo My accommodations budget is an average of 100 per night though Im very open to lowercost options such as capsule hotels Im allround in terms of interest so any entertainment recommendations are acceptable that being said food recommendations would be prioritized the most I saw that there is a 7Day Rail Pass offered to nonJapanese tourists though the price for it is a bit steep 279 Im wondering if this is worth it or it my domestic travel budget should be spent elsewhere My budget for Japan would be roughly 4500 though Ill change it if needed Any thoughts tips and recommendations would be great as it would help a lot with my planning,Planning a Vacation Need Tips Recommendations Tips,408

17120,travel,For the last few months weve been getting multiple posts a day on American Passport Questions To help alleviate the amount of posts and make sure everyone is getting the same information Ive created this Megathread While this post was kicked off due to American Passport questions feel free to ask questions about any nationality THE BEST ADVICE IS APPLY AND RENEW EARLY ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PASSPORTS EXPIRATION DATE PUT YOUR PASSPORT IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT DO NOT CHECK EXPIRATION OR LOCATION OF PASSPORT THE NIGHT BEFORE CHECK IT EARLY American Passport Information Frequently Asked Questions for Applying Within the US How to Apply All Information can be found here There will be a form to fill out Information on passport photos What documents IDs youll need etc Where to Apply Then youll need to see which avenue youll need to apply at This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office an actual Passport Agency or via mail for renewals If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information NOTE Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins Processing Times As of May 2021 You can find the latest processing times here Normal processing is around 1012 weeks Expedited processing is around 46 weeks You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility that is an added cost is an additional addon to Expedited passports Life or Death Urgent Emergency Service is around 72 hours3 business days NOTE This timing may not include shipping time There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times NOTE Some facilities may be quicker others may take longer the above time is the average We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate Do not book travel to the day of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport because again it does not include shipping times NOTE DUE TO INCREASE SUMMER DEMAND EXPECT PROCESSING TIMES TO INCREASE AND APPOINTMENTS BECOME HARDER TO GET They cashed my check does that mean my passport is coming soon No During covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to 4 weeks Them cashing the check doesnt mean they are processing it or that everything is going well Once they start processing it if they find errors or your paperwork IDs etc arent in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues Can I get a same day passport Not likely during covid since they arent taking walk in appointments My trip is in a few days and I just realized I dont have my passportits lostits expiredwhatever HELP WHAT DO I DO In all honesty you are pretty much SOL It is almost impossible to get the UrgentLife or DeathEmergency inperson appointments For these urgent appointments you must call them directly via the phone numbers on the above link If you are trying to go that route youll need to look at any location you can realistically get to INCLUDING flying to them Note that many people have faked life or deathemergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments Otherwise you may be better off calling all your prebooked vacation expenses and see if you have any options to postpone or refund your nownothappeningtrip My trip is within the next 24 weeks and I need a passport HELP WHAT DO I DO There may be extremely limited appointments for Urgent nonemergency travel but this will need to be done at a Passport Agency which do not accept walk ins And you can try to apply via this link Note that many people have faked life or deathemergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments If you are trying to go that route youll need to look at any location you can realistically get to INCLUDING flying to them My trip is in the next 410 weeks what should I do I wouldnt bank on Expedited processing if your trip is 4 weeks away instead go read above for other options If your trip is under 57 weeks away Id recommend doing the Expedited processing WITH Expedited Shipping and at Week 34 contact your states House of Representatives to see if they can ensure your passport is moving along properly If you are traveling 8 weeks out Expedited processing would be best My trip is 1013 weeks out Id suggest normal processing BUT with expedited shipping At week 78 if you dont see progress contact your states House of Representatives to see if they can ensure your passport is moving along properly My trip is more than 13 weeks out Just do Normal processing Sure it would be nice to get it faster but if you dont have trave plans dont fuck over someone else who actually does need to get their passport faster by taking one of their slots I submitted my passport ages ago but my status hasnt changedits been WAY past the processing times quoted on the website There may be a problem Try contacting the State DepartmentPassport Office or reach out to your state House of Representative They actually can often help with speeding along passports and fixing issues when they get stuck in the system My Status on the website says Not Available It can take up to 4 weeks for your status to change to InProgress How do I find my States House of Representative This link will help you Once you are in contact and have asked for help on your passport application you may be asked to fill out a privacy form or other paperwork allowing your representative to work on your behalf Make sure to follow up quickly to keep the ball rolling Can I buy a flight that shows Im leaving within 3 business days get my passport and then cancel the flightCan I fake a family emergency Yes but given that those appointments are supposed to be those with life and death emergencies and right now those appointments are VERY hard to get even if you have a valid reasonsp try not being a dick maybe What about using a 3rd Party RushExpediting ServiceCourierExpeditor There is no magical service other than contacting your states house of representative that can get you your passport quicker than official channels You are instead paying a shit ton of money for someone else to do any of the above steps and faster processing isnt guaranteed or possible As well as there are many outright scam companies out there I would not recommend you give them your personal information See the official government info here on why you should not use these Can I travel internationally by air without a passport book For air travel the airline wont even let you on your first initial flight if you do not have proper documentation and visas This is because the airline will be penalized and fined if you are held and deported due to improper documentationvisas A passport card cannot be used for air travel Can I travel internationally by land without a passport We frequently get questions on this especially for the USAMexico border Officially no you actually do need a passport Unofficially some people have reported getting INTO Mexico without a passport can be easier than coming BACK into the US without a passport Can I travel internationally via a cruise without a passport Wed recommend hitting up rcruise as it may depend on your specific cruise Some may not allow you on at all without a passport others simply wont let you do shore excursions if you dont have a passport I have dual citizenship can I travel on my other passport instead While USA has no exit immigration so you dont need to show your passport to exit you are required to enter the USA on your American passport You cannot use your other citizenship to get a visa to enter America on your other passport So unless you are going to get your passport abroad at an EmbassyConsulate before you return get your American passport before you go Other Questions What is the difference between a Passport Book and a Passport Card Card is for Land borders and some sea ports of entry Think Canada Mexico Caribbean Bermuda You cannot use it for air travel If you plan on doing any air travel within the next 10 years get the passport book Ive heard about 6 Month Validity Rule what is it and what does it mean Some countries require the passport to still be valid 6 months after entry or exit This is to ensure you have valid documents to be able to exit the country Some countries do not have this requirement some require it to be 3 months etc But the easiest way to think about it is your passport actually expires 6 months early And so its best to renew it before that time I lost my passport reported it lost and now just found the original one can I travel on it No Once reported loststolen its deactivated and cannot be used for travel You should put a hole through a corner of the passport or otherwise make it clear it cannot be used so you dont accidentally bring it to the airport I got part of my order but didnt get my old passportnew passportpassport cardmy ID documents Theyll come in separate shipments Other FAQs from the source ONE KEY RULE If you are answering any question with timing of how long it took you to get your passport you MUST state when this happened Anyone with I got my passport same day within 2 weeks and the response was This was 2019 or early will be temporarily banned for wasting peoples time with false hope People want to understand RECENT experiences during COVID Not the beforetimes Remember the State Department is likely 12 MILLION Passports behind and not all locations have fully opened up,Passport Questions Issues Megathread Summer 2021,1745

17217,travel,Hi guys so Im planning a two persons 1 month trip to Turkey later this year and would like to know your guys opinion on the following itinerary and budget some of the budgets for

noons of day 2 3 and 4 to visit around some major sights like Hagia Sophia Blue Mosque Topkapi Palace Hippodrome Kariye mosque Obelisk of TheodosiusHagia Irene and Grand Bazaar and if there is enough time Basilica Cistern Suleymaniye Mosque Galata Tower Tour Zeyrek Mosque Spice Bazaar Bosphorus Cruise I will return later in my trip to Istanbul so there is no hurry to cover all of these in only 3 halfdays and the evenings we would spend relaxing and doing some wfhworking from home at the hotel On the forth day take flight to Izmir Accommodation 130 Day 46 Izmir 3 days 2 nights Day 1 arrive and see around Izmir Ancient Smyrna Agora St Johns cathedral and Polycarp Church Day 2 Go to Pergamum Asclepion the ancient hospital the Acropolis the Church at the site of Serapium 7C and the Red Court

Domestic flights 1972 394 International flights around 8002 1600 Total Accomodationsflights 3684 OPTION 2 There is a very friendly tour agency that has contacted me they offer me an allinclusive 6 days guided tour to the major sites Istanbul Pamukkale Ephesus and Cappadocia for around 930 per person The reason Im considering this option is that the main reason of the trip is to spend some time with my wife since we have been separated due to the pandemic so we are kinda okay with just getting to see the main sites also you may be able to see Im planning on a relatively slow pace trip taking in some cities and specially making some time to work if I take this tour I can get the main sites out of the way in the first week and get the rest of the days to relax in some other cities It also provides the benefit of not having to stress about some bookings and of course getting the insights only a certified tour guide can get and the price is by far the best option Ive seen so far Plus I know how hard the pandemic has hit travel agencies and I would like to help with how little I can If I take this option the itinerary would be as follows Day 16 Day 1 transfer to hotel in istanbul Day 2 Full day Istanbul Old City Tour BY walk Breakfast and Lunch included Day 3 Flight to Denizli Full day Pamukkale Tour Lunch included Day 4 Full day Regular Ephesus Virgin Mary House Artemis Tour Flight to Cappadocia Breakfast and Lunch included Day 5 Hot Air Balloon Tour Full day Regular Northern Cappodocia Tour Breakfast and Lunch included Day 6 Full day Southern Cappadocia Tour Total

17221,travel,Hi everyone Crossposting from rAirBnB This is not an AirBnbspecific post so I figured trying here would be a safe bet Mods if this isnt allowed feel free to notify me My wife and I have our anniversary trip coming up this weekend Over a month ago I booked a cabin for 2 nights from Glamping Hub Long story short I had strict parameters when choosing a cabin one of them was that it NEEDS to be dog friendly Well this cabin posting on Glamping Hub claimed it was dog friendly and it checked my other boxes so I booked it I hadnt received any info from the host since booking it so I referenced the confirmation email I received after submitting my booking I wanted to doublecheck the amenities to see if they had a firepit I try to click on the link to the cabin posting and the post is gone I tried Google searching the post and even typed in different dates and for whatever reason the host straight up took the entire property listing off Glamping Hub completely Huh this is weird I thought So I tried other websites and I found the cabin posted on Airbnb I clicked on the post to check out the picturesamenities to see if there was a firepit and I noticed their pet policy said NO PETS So now Im like well shit The Glamping Hub post said clear as day that PETS WERE ALLOWED They deleted this listing mysteriously so now Im caught with my pants down The entire reason I booked this cabin was for the pet policy There were nicer cabins I could have chosen from that didnt allow dogs but we vehemently did not want to board our dog for a few days This is literally the entire reason we made this booking and wanted a cabin in general What are my options here I already sent an email asking why the Glamping Hub post was deleted and also requested the phone number for the host Am I screwed If I can get a full refund I will Hell if they want to charge extra since we brought a dog Im fine with that too This is such a pain in the ass especially considering Ive had this planned and booked for so long,Upcoming Cabin Trip Inaccurate Information Need Advice,388

17247,travel,Having spent the last couple of hours digging into this I decided Id share some of what I learned while digging through Pricelines express and pricebreaker deals First It is possible to see which hotel you are going to be getting with these deals For example There is currently a Express deal for a 4star hotel in NYC It tells me the hotel will be one of three Fifty Hotel Affinia Fitzpatrick Hotel and Hotel 57 I wonder which hotel it could possibly be Oh would you look at that The important info section contains a blurb about Affinia Oops You can also match check in times or look at the prediscount prices For example in our case the three hotels it gives us to choose from are priced at 180192288 The prediscount rate is 191 Pretty easy to figure out Its a lot more difficult to do with the pricebreaker deals as they are significantly more censored but can still be done Second The hotel you get is already chosen when the deal got put together Despite Pricelines attempt to make it appear otherwise there is no random selection going on where you are just as likely to get the 350 hotel as the 200 hotel when you are paying 160 There seems to be differing criteria but it is almost always one of the cheaper two Its almost never the most expensive one unless it is within 25ish of the cheapest one Third The same hotel usually appears in multiple pricebreakers and is usually offered for a couple of dollars cheaper as an express deal Another quick way to get an idea of which hotel you will actually get look at the ones that pop up multiple times on the list Other hotels in the area will rotate in and out but the one that they chose will show up multiple times Fourth You can often get the same supersecretextremedeal simply by checking the hotel website for promotions,My research on Priceline deals Mostly trash with a few gems,330

18384,travel, Hi I am new to this subreddit so I dont know if this is a good question to ask on here but I think it belongs here I am already doing some research for once it is possible to travel again I am interested in traveling by train as I dont own a car and wont own one for quite a while but I dont like the idea of having to constantly buy tickets everywhere I heard from my friends that there are are these seasonal cards you can buy that allow you to travel within a specific area during a certain time period without having to buy a ticket constantly I would prefer one for whole of europe or the EU which is valid for like a year and you can travel during any time of the day but I imagine that doesnt exist sadly sounds to good to be true So I wonder if it what the best train cards are per country I live in the Netherlands and I mainly want to travel to Germany France Italy etc It would be cool to travel to scandinavia as well but I imagine that the train network is not good enough to take me that far I would like to be able to go to especially germany and france more often I also like to travel to the UK as I have a friend who lives there so I wonder if there is a similar type of card just for the UK and maybe one for going through channel as well Also maybe this is a stupid question but in the Netherlands you can take bikes on a train is this allowed in other countries as well Or just in the Netherlands Being able to take my bike would be really useful for traveling more quickly within a city Sorry if this is a dumb question and if there are any spelling mistakes,What are the best seasonal train cards in europe,324

18461,travel,I just want to preface this by saying that I am specifically talking about large international or national hotel chains Hilton Marriott Choice ect As an employee of such company have some advice for you lets start with the upgrades 1 SIGN UP FOR THE LOYALTY PROGRAMS This is the BEST way to get free upgradesother freebiesreduced prices Its free to sign up and you will generally get higher quality service from staff 2 Book directly with the hotel Which might sound a little backwards considering its almost always cheeper to book through Expedia but if theres an issue or you need to cancel or anything third party sites will try to screw you every time Most of the time if you go on the hotel chains website to book and you sign up for the loyalty program you can knock about 1030 off the room price 3 Be nice to staff just in general were more likely to go out of our way to hook you up with a better room if we have it available and help you with special requests if youre nice to us also if there an issue with your room or anything try not to cause a huge scene its literally our job to make sure youre having a nice stay and we want to fix issues for you like Ill still help if youre an asshole but you kinda suck tbh youre literally just making this take longer than it needs to be bc you want to yell about pillows 4 Just ask us The worst we can say is no and there no harm in asking for an upgrade Okay now for the good stuff 5 Consider a side hustle in hospitality Were desperate for staff rn american here The employee discounts are really great Im talking less than 50ish a night depending on the brandchain Even if you work 2 days a week in laundry or food service COLLEGE STUDENTS Night auditors get paid a little more than most positions and outside of working over night its a pretty sweet gig but if thats not your style 6 pays to be a family member or friend of hotel staff I can not speak for all chains but Hilton has a friends and family discount its not as good as mine but its about 50 off the rack rate also 70 f f nights and 30 employee nights is a lot of nights of discounts 7 Try to book as far in advance as possible generally rates will increase as the dates approach and we get more reservations and try to never make reservations by walking in you will always be quoted more that way 8 Tell the staff why youre there if you happen to be on a business trip ask if theres a discount or negotiated rate for them it never hurts to ask 9 You can try to negotiate prices if you happen to catch a manger working the desk you can try to negotiate a little bit this doesnt always work but sometimes it does dont be a dick about it 10 book for longer periods of time 34 days instead of a quick two day weekend vacation it all depends on the market of the area youre visiting but usually week day rates are cheeper 🤷🏻‍♀️ alright thats all,How to score hotel rooms for cheep or get free upgrades,562

19029,travel,While vaccines are starting to be administered in several countries the coronavirus COVID19 situation continues to have a major effect on travel with many now looking to understand if when or how their travels might be feasible Accordingly rtravel is continue its megathreads on a monthly basis until the crisis dissipates In the interest of reducing the number of oneoff questions before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following Are borders open What entry or transit restrictions are in place Will I need to quarantine A list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources including from IATA or Kayaks travel restriction map Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures You may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country Because information can change on short notice it is important to verify the latest information ideally from government sources in the US At the time of writing foreign nationals are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in or transited via Brazil China India as of May 4 Iran Ireland the Schengen Area South Africa or the UK in the preceding 14 days Exceptions to this rule include green card holders as well as some family members of US citizens and permanent residents Note that except for of course US citizens this is not a citizenshipbased restriction it is purely based on travel history More information about the entry restrictions and the associated proclamations is available on the US CDC website All air passengers including US citizens and green card holders regardless of origin and nationality need to produce a negative result from a viral test taken within 3 days of the first flight on a single ticket to the US Alternatively you may travel with a positive test result from the previous 3 months and a letter from a doctor indicating that youre clear for travel The land borders with Mexico and Canada are closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes but air rail and sea but not commuter rail or ferry portsofentry remain open to nonessential travel No nationwide quarantine requirements exist although an executive order signed on Jan 21 hinted at the possibility of one being instituted should the CDC recommend it Nevertheless individual states andor cities may have their own requirements even for domestic travel so you will need to confirm with information from your destination state or city As an example this is New York States travel advisoryquarantine page note that travelers are permitted to break quarantine to leave New York State and the states quarantine restrictions would not prevent you from boarding a connecting flight New Yorks testing and quarantine requirements are ending for domestic travelers as of Apr 1 Note also that COVID tests are not being demanded at checkin security boarding or arrival for domestic travel within the contiguous United States and checkpoints arent being set up at state borders For more information see the US CDCs COVID19 page in Canada At the time of writing foreign nationals are barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for certain mostly essential reasons regardless of mode of travel Those traveling from countries other than the US must also fulfill one of several additional categories of exemptions Those who are permitted to travel to Canada for nonessential purposes include – aside from Canadians – permanent residents and certain family members of Canadians and permanent residents Note that Canadian airlines will be halting flights to Mexico and the Caribbean Those wishing to travel to Canada on compassionate reasons may do so provided they receive authorization from the Public Health Agency of Canada Fully airside international transits are typically permitted All passengers five years or older arriving into Canada by air will also need to produce a negative result from a PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to boarding the last direct flight to Canada Alternatively you may submit a positive COVID19 molecular test taken between 14 and 90 days prior to departure Passengers are required to take an additional test on arrival and quarantine at hotels for at least three days pending negative test results in one of four cities – Vancouver Calgary Toronto and Montreal – that will serve as the only portsofentry by air After being permitted to exit hotel quarantine travelers must continue to selfquarantine until 14 days after arrival at which point they must take another test The whole process is expected to cost approximately C2000 per passenger which travelers will have to pay For more information see the Canadian governments COVID19 travel restrictions page in Mexico At the time of writing there are no changes to Mexicos standard entry requirements However the land border with the United States is officially closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes Travelers must fill out a Questionnaire of Identification of Risk Factors in Travelers available here to present upon arrival There are no quarantine or testing requirements upon arrival in Mexico For more information see information provided by Mexican embassies including the Mexican Embassy in the Netherlands in the UK At the time of writing foreign nationals are barred from entering the UK if they have entered or transited several several countries including but not limited to South American countries Panama the UAE Qatar India and several countries in southern Africa within the previous 10 days are not permitted to enter the UK The full red list of countriestravelbanstotheukbannedcountries is subject to change Irish citizens and those with UK resident permits are in addition to UK nationals exempted from this restriction All passengers entering or transiting through the UK from outside the Common Travel Area which comprises the UK Ireland the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands need to produce a negative PCR LAMP or antigen test taken within 72 hours of their last direct flight or other mode of transit to the UK All international arrivals including UK citizens will need to quarantine for 10 days after arrival Passengers who have not been in any of the red list countries over the previous ten days may shorten their quarantines in England if they test negative at least 5 days into their quarantine period All travelers regardless of origin and nationality traveling from outside the Common Travel Area will in addition to getting tested before departure need to take a test on the second and eighth days after arrival this requirement even applies to those using the testtorelease scheme These tests need to be prebooked before departure All travelers that have been in any of the red list countries over the previous ten days must book at their own expense a hotel room for their quarantine For those destined for Scotland all travelers who have been outside the Common Travel Area in the previous ten days must book a hotel room for their quarantines These hotel rooms must be booked in advance along with the mandatory tests on the second and eighth days of quarantine With lockdown measures in place within the UK there may be restrictions on travel purposes to from or within the constituent countries For example travel to and from Scotland is prohibited except for limited purposes For more information see UK Border Control and the UK governments information about travel measures in the EU In the Schengen Area In late June 2020 the European Commission recommended that external borders be reopened to shortterm visitors arriving from several countries deemed to have adequately maintained the virus This list has been updated as of Jan 28 to consist of Australia China subject to confirmation of reciprocity New Zealand Rwanda Singapore South Korea and Thailand This list however is nonbinding among member countries and is subject to change Nevertheless several countries within the EU or the Schengen Area have used this list as guidance permitting arrivals from these countries as well as EU countries which includes EU and Schengen countries and sometimes the UK These restrictions typically are not based on nationality but rather travel history andor residency consult resources from your destination country However multiple EU countries have temporarily placed additional restrictions on travel from specific countries eg the UK or have reinstated broad restrictions for those from outside the EU the Schengen Area or their own countries due to discoveries of new COVID variants Fully airside nonSchengen to nonSchengen transits are typically permitted but confirm and consult resources from your transit country to see if further documentation which may at times include negative test results is required Recent reports from a European Commission official suggest that vaccinated travelers will be permitted to travel to Europe this summer However firm details about these plans have not been announced and each EU country has the ultimate say on its border policies Among the European countries that have made announcements about possibly reopening to vaccinated travelers are France targeting Jun 9 Greece already open if traveling from certain countries and Iceland already open As the various EU and Schengen countries have opened their external borders to thirdcountry nationals in various ways and with different exceptions it is imperative that travelers check the entry requirements for their portsofentry A summary of travel restrictions is provided by the European Union but many have reported that government eg embassy or foreign ministry resources have been more detailed and accurate in South Korea At the time of writing most nationalities with visafree or visawaiver arrangements with Korea have had their visafreewaiver status suspended primarily on the basis of the reciprocal entry restrictions for Korean citizens There are also additional entry and transit restrictions of those traveling from China All passengers must have a negative LAMP PCR SDA or TMA test taken within 72 hours of departure of the first flight en route to Korea International arrivals with very few exceptions will be required to quarantine for 14 days nonresidents will be required to quarantine in government facilities at their own expense For more information see the Korea Immigration Service in Japan At the time of writing foreign nationals who have been in one of 150 countries for purposes other than transit are not permitted to enter Japan Further visas and visa exemptions for nationals from many countries have been suspended Permanent residents longterm residents and spouses and children of Japanese citizens may be exempt from these entry restrictions provided they meet certain conditions Those individuals including Japanese citizens that are permitted to enter Japan will be required to undergo a 14day quarantine All travelers will be required to provide proof of a negative result from a test taken within 72 hours of departure for Japan Additional restrictions are in place for those travelling from the UK or South Africa For more information see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan in Thailand At the time of writing Thailand is accepting travelers that have the proper visa or are visaexempt Visaonarrival facilities as well as visaexempt status for nationals of Cambodia and Myanmar are suspended Travelers entering or transiting Thailand must have a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of the first embarkation point All travelers entering the country are subject to a 14day quarantine Foreigners must have a confirmed hotel reservation for their quarantine and well as health insurance with coverage of at least US100000 When will borders reopen or travel restrictions be lifted Is it safea good idea to book travel for a particular time months ahead It is of course impossible to say when travel restrictions are lifted for every country Where no news has been officially provided it is often very difficult to predict as countries will make decisions based on the progress of the pandemic – which is an unknown – as well as other pressures eg economic or social Consider that the progress of the pandemic and efforts to combat it are unpredictable Countries are approaching the vaccine rollouts in different ways Some countries are exempting vaccinated travelers from testing or quarantine requirements and some are even allowing vaccinated travelers to enter when they would not admit unvaccinated travelers However one should not assume special treatment on account of your vaccinated status as most countries still have not differentiated between vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers In the meantime with the resurgences of cases and new variants recently discovered in several countries some countries have firmed up travel restrictions requiring additional tests or quarantine periods or preventing travel from certain locations Further even if you are ultimately able to travel to your destination there may be lockdowns or widespread closures of businesses and places of interest Realize that you are taking a risk by deciding to speculatively book travel in the hopes that travel restrictions will be lifted by the time you travel or even will remain as liberal as they are in your destination today With this unprecedented situation old adages about when its best to purchase airfare may no longer be valid In any event be aware of the policies of your airlines and accommodations for credits andor refunds should you need to reschedule or cancel Further understand that airlines may make it very difficult to receive a refund even if legally required Many travelers have reported waiting months to receive refunds on cancelled flights or otherwise being stonewalled when requesting a refund And be aware that if your airline goes out of business your funds could be lost forever Take note of your jurisdictions laws regarding refunds for cancelled flights For example US Dept of Transportation Refunds EU Air passenger rights So should I cancel a trip that Ive already booked And how Will insurance help These questions were covered at length in the second megathread Although countries may be starting to reopen the points therein are still relevant Previous related megathreads First virus megathread Jan 23–Mar 15 2020 Europe to US travel suspension megathread Mar 12–15 2020 Second virus megathread Mar

19145,travel, Hey everyone So my boyfriend applied for a passport last March 2020 just as all the craziness was starting to really kick up We didnt hear back anything for months but figured it was due to the current state of the world In September he received a letter about his passport not the actual passport however he never physically received the letter because we also moved in September and it was lost in the mail I checked on the passport information site and it says if you receive a letter about your passport it means you are missing some information however ever time he calls they tell him they arent missing any information and theyre still backed up This is a little strange to me because no where on their site does it indicate that it should take over a year and we also have friends who applied for passports just a few months ago and have already received them back Im pretty frustrated at this point and just would like to know any advice on taking next steps Should we request another letter If so how do we do this When we check the passport status online it says passport not found and everytime we call they say it should arrive in a few weeks weve updated our address This might sound silly but is there a supervisor or direct line we can call to at least get some trackingprocessing information Any leads would be helpful,Havent received passport in over a year,247
